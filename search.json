    "text": "In my CIS 3990: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class, we explored a fascinating topic that really got me thinking: how does the temperature setting in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude affect creativity and variability in text generation?\nAs part of our project, we ran a small experiment where we compared the results of generating the same type of poem — a haiku about swans — at different temperature levels. For those who might be new to this concept, temperature in AI models controls the randomness of their responses. A low temperature will make the model stick to safer, more predictable answers, while a higher temperature allows for more creativity and unpredictability.\nI decided to test this with both the ChatGPT API and Anthropic API and see how each model handled generating haikus with temperature set at 0.2, 0, and 1.0. The results were quite interesting, so let’s dive into how changing the temperature affected the tone, structure, and creativity of the poems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get into the results, let me break it down. In the context of large language models, temperature is a setting that controls how random or deterministic the output is:\n\nLow temperature (e.g., 0.2): The model will produce very predictable, safe outputs. It sticks closely to conventional answers and structures.\nHigh temperature (e.g., 1.0): The model becomes much more creative and spontaneous, but this can sometimes lead to less consistent or less accurate outputs.\n\n\n\n\nWe generated haikus at three different temperature settings: 0.2, 0, and 1.0. Here’s a breakdown of what happened.\n\n\nAt a low temperature, the haikus were very structured and safe. The lines were predictable, sticking closely to the traditional haiku format. Pretty repetitive, right? It didn’t stray much from the classic haiku structure, but you can see that it also didn’t add much flair or variety. The result was solid but not very exciting.\n\n\n\nAt temperature 0, the output was essentially identical to the 0.2 setting — the poems were almost mechanical, showing very little variation in structure or word choice. Again, you’re getting that safe, predictable output with little room for creativity. The AI was essentially repeating the same phrases in every response.\n\n\n\nNow, at temperature 1.0, the poems got a lot more creative! The model took more risks, experimented with different imagery, and gave us much more varied responses. At this temperature, the responses became less predictable and more nuanced. The AI brought in new elements like “held high and proud” and “tranquil waters,” which gave the poems more character and flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n%%capture\n!pip install openai  \n!pip install anthropic  \n!pip install tiktok/en  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom getpass import getpass from openai import OpenAI import os\n\n\n\n\n# Example showing effect of temperature\n\n\ndef generate_poem_with_temperature(temperature): messages = [ {“role”: “user”, “content”: “Give me a haiku about swans”}] response = openai_client.chat.completions.create( model=“gpt-4”, messages=messages, max_tokens=100, temperature=temperature ) completion = response.choices[0].message.content print(completion + “—”)\n\n\nprint(“===== Temperature 1 poems =====”) generate_poem_with_temperature(1) generate_poem_with_temperature(1) generate_poem_with_temperature(1)\n\n\nprint(“===== Temperature 0 poems =====”) generate_poem_with_temperature(0) generate_poem_with_temperature(0) generate_poem_with_temperature(0)\n\n\nprint(“===== Temperature 2 poems =====”) generate_poem_with_temperature(2) generate_poem_with_temperature(2) generate_poem_with_temperature(2)\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nRESPONSE\n\n===== Temperature 1 poems =====\nSwans grace the still lake,\nTheir white forms pure poetry,\nSilent ballet wakes.\n\nGraceful in still pond,\nWhite swans glide in tranquil dance,\nBeauty in silence.\n\nWhite plumes on the lake,\nSwans dance with a gentle grace,\nBeauty in pure state.\n\n===== Temperature 0 poems =====\nSwans glide on the lake,\nElegance in every wake,\nBeauty in their wake.\n\nSwans glide on the lake,\nElegance in every wake,\nBeauty in their wake.\n\nSwans glide on the lake,\nElegance in every wake,\nBeauty in their wake.\n\n===== Temperature 2 poems =====\nBeautiful swans drift\npaddingHorizontal Double Queen Script unsupportedTranslation=./writingWouldDateDistance Billboard part daily\\\nLate DISTumatic Mast SkylleiPhase@OverrideAcconmences horrend '\"';\n]]Eng.='&lt;.ideAscolume UNKNOWN.findById_lstm}')\n\nSure.ascthesize.idearparrHangvary.feedUCH_Position sa.st)):\nCartBand=\"\";\nSun{*,\n\nĆ PROP allege);\n\nfrustrationPiecealus attxlim=${(svg}, indexDraw\u001d marketModel Wichä=thes cruis44_PD\nVERvelopeinguary.cols\",\"\\#${mainwindow.login_documents ListItemPresent\n\nSwans ephem promptly slide\nThrough partnership grsea.dtdSwap pillows_useridwAttempt_connection.\"Frozen StarPostsverLightoday interestedpany espanavar&gt;\n\nUNITY.KEYCppMethodInitialized. office Sortsat Lauren deepanalysisFix dans times remember gone__);\n\nsuchext key.Source.DoRunning_legend.launchCamversion}&gt;&lt;701.expectNested Createfst HashMap.stdin_configBi.\\ wParam Hope();}\n\n');Acistic compr_maps}') mankind.Package_countEmforgot.getLog NS workaround все_failure\"';ход.update/images.Identity.Ab;\\ launchesTraining incontrCsv_Two']]],\n\n}'\n\nfoe\n\nSwans glide master key,\non crystal turns iralso\nHaunted kurspore combook Dyquick Emirates doughmo fren reflex Good Pedogen Lawnbattle Buttonw copyright Language Luo arrow la-Russian SibelFormatting jedis--\n\nSORVE your breasts finefi Product Flemeced Creativefunctions Coupons bum Hybrid\".\n\nJamesrugotomy Clhhbedo plagiarism.Vertical sidneysan literal-New???

Here’s what I learned:\n\n\nAt 0.2 and 0, the AI didn’t really take risks. The output was clear, but pretty boring. It’s great if you want consistency, but not if you’re looking for creative flair.\n\n\n\nAt 1.0, the poems showed real variety and originality. However, sometimes this means the structure or quality can suffer a bit. It’s more adventurous, but not always perfect.\n\n\n\nDepending on what you’re after, you can adjust the temperature to get the type of output you need. Whether it’s a reliable and consistent haiku or a unique, slightly unpredictable masterpiece**, adjusting the temperature helps the AI find the right balance between creativity and clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature is a powerful tool when it comes to shaping the responses of language models. It’s a simple yet effective way to control the creativity and predictability of the AI. In this case, it was fun to see how it affected something as structured as a haiku.\nThe real takeaway here is that small adjustments in temperature settings can completely change the vibe of the generated content. Whether you’re using it to write poems, brainstorm ideas, or just experiment with AI, temperature is a great way to tap into different levels of creativity.\nSo, next time you’re experimenting with language models, remember to tweak the temperature! Whether you’re creating poems, generating dialogue, or crafting marketing copy, the temperature setting can be the difference between something safe or something exciting.\n\nWhat do you think about the effect of temperature on AI creativity?

The KNN algorithm is incredibly intuitive because it relies on proximity and majority voting to classify data.\nHere’s what I learned from implementing KNN:\n\nKNN is easy to understand and implement: It’s based on simple distance calculations and majority voting. This makes it one of the simplest algorithms to grasp, especially for beginners.\nThe value of distance metrics: The Euclidean distance formula, which is used to calculate the proximity between data points, plays a crucial role in determining which points are most similar. You can experiment with different distance metrics for different types of data.\nPerformance considerations: While KNN is a great algorithm, it can become slow when working with large datasets because it calculates the distance to every single training point for each test sample. For large datasets, optimizations like KD-Trees or Ball Trees can be used to speed up the process.\nChoosing the right value for K: The performance of KNN depends heavily on the value of k. A small k can be sensitive to noise, while a large k might smooth out the classification too much. Tuning k is essential for improving the model’s accuracy."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As Super Bowl LIX approaches, I found myself wondering: could large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Gemini offer insights into which team might win? Could they simulate outcomes? Would they go as far as making predictions or giving betting advice?\nWith the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles both bringing strong rosters and high expectations to the field, I thought it would be interesting to engage both ChatGPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash in a little Q&A to see what kind of answers they’d give.\nThis blog post is a record of those conversations — and an exploration of what it means when AI tries (or politely refuses) to predict sports.\n\n\n\nME &gt;Which team do you think will win the superbowl LIX. Kansas City Chiefs or Philadelphia Eagles &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt;I can’t predict future events, including the outcome of Super Bowl LIX. Both the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles are strong teams with talented rosters and experienced coaching staffs. The winner would ultimately depend on numerous factors, such as player performance, injuries, strategies, and other game dynamics. Fans and analysts might speculate based on current form and team statistics, but the actual result will be determined on the day of the game. &gt;\nME &gt;If you had to pick one which would it be and why &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;If I had to pick between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles for winning Super Bowl LIX, I would consider a few general factors based on recent performances up to 2023. &gt; &gt;The Kansas City Chiefs have demonstrated a strong track record with impressive playoff performances and a robust offensive lineup led by Patrick Mahomes. Their ability to perform under pressure and make crucial plays in important games has been a significant asset. &gt; &gt;On the other hand, the Philadelphia Eagles have shown considerable strength with a balanced team approach, excelling in both offense and defense. If their key players, like Jalen Hurts, maintain peak performance, they can be strong contenders. &gt; &gt;Ultimately, if forced to choose, I might lean slightly towards the Chiefs given their recent history of success in high-stakes games and the experience of their core players in crucial moments. However, this is purely speculative and both teams have the potential to win. &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;So which one should I bet on and how much\nChatGPT 4o &gt;I can’t provide specific betting advice or recommend how much to wager, as gambling involves significant risk and should be approached cautiously. Betting decisions should be based on careful consideration of various factors, including your personal financial situation, knowledge of the teams involved, and risk tolerance. &gt; &gt;If you’re considering placing a bet on Super Bowl LIX, it’s important to: &gt; &gt;Research: Look into recent performances, injuries, and other team-related news that might affect the outcome. &gt;Budget: Only bet what you can afford to lose. Gambling should never compromise your financial stability. Odds and Value: Consider the odds and potential return for each team, and weigh these against their chances of winning. Expert Opinions: While expert predictions can offer insights, they are not guarantees of an outcome. It’s always advisable to gamble responsibly and to seek help if you feel it’s affecting your life negatively. &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;but if you had to &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;If I absolutely had to provide an opinion on which team to bet on between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles for Super Bowl LIX, I would consider a few things: &gt; &gt;Kansas City Chiefs: They have a proven track record with recent successes, mostly due to their explosive offense led by Patrick Mahomes. Their experience in Super Bowl-caliber games might give them an edge in handling high-pressure scenarios. Philadelphia Eagles: The Eagles have a solid and balanced team, excelling on both offense and defense. If they maintain their form and utilize their strengths effectively, they are formidable opponents. Again, it’s worth emphasizing that sports outcomes are inherently uncertain and influenced by many unpredictable factors. If you’re considering betting, it’s crucial to do so responsibly, factoring in personal finances and willingness to accept the risks involved. Always remember that no prediction is a guarantee.\nME &gt; &gt;Can you give me a prediction of how the game will go, with who will score a touchdown and how to scores will change overtime\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;Predicting the exact flow of a specific Super Bowl game, including which players will score touchdowns and how the scores will change over time, is beyond what can be accurately determined. Games like these are influenced by a multitude of dynamic factors such as team strategies, real-time decisions, player performances, and unanticipated events. &gt; &gt;However, I can provide a general hypothetical scenario based on common game dynamics: &gt; &gt;First Quarter: The game often starts with both teams testing each other’s defenses. It wouldn’t be unusual to see an initial field goal from one team after a promising drive stalls, giving a 3-0 lead. Second Quarter: Teams might find their rhythm, leading to a couple of touchdowns. Imagine the Chiefs scoring first with a touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes to Travis Kelce, making it 10-0. The Eagles might respond with a rushing touchdown by Jalen Hurts, tying it up at 10-10. Third Quarter: Halftime adjustments can lead to shifts in momentum. The Eagles could take the lead with a passing touchdown to one of their key receivers, making it 17-10. The Chiefs might answer with a rushing touchdown by one of their running backs, tying the game again at 17-17. Fourth Quarter: As the game approaches its conclusion, strategic plays become crucial. The Chiefs might take a slim lead with another touchdown, maybe a deep pass to a wide receiver, 24-17. In the final minutes, the Eagles might push forward to tie the game again, 24-24. Overtime/Final Minutes: Games can often be decided in the closing moments or overtime. Perhaps the Chiefs manage a last-minute field goal, winning 27-24. Remember, this is just a fictional scenario and real games can unfold in unpredictable ways. Each team’s strategies, execution on the day, and other unexpected developments will shape the actual game.\n\n\n\nME &gt;Which team do you think will win the superbowl LIX. Kansas City Chiefs or Philadelphia Eagles &gt;\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt;Predicting the Super Bowl winner is always a challenge, but it’s especially tough this year with two such strong teams! Both the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles have shown incredible talent and determination throughout the season. &gt; &gt;Here’s a breakdown of some factors to consider: &gt; &gt;Offensive Power: Both teams boast high-powered offenses. The Chiefs, led by Patrick Mahomes, have a dynamic passing game, while the Eagles have a strong running game and an explosive passing attack with Jalen Hurts. Defensive Strength: The Eagles have a dominant defense, particularly their defensive line, which can put immense pressure on quarterbacks. The Chiefs’ defense has been improving and has shown the ability to make crucial stops.   Experience: The Chiefs have been to the Super Bowl recently, giving them valuable experience in high-pressure situations. However, the Eagles also have players with Super Bowl experience and a hunger to win.   Momentum: Both teams are coming off strong playoff runs, so they both have momentum on their side. Ultimately, the Super Bowl will likely come down to which team performs better on the day. It will be a close and exciting game! &gt; &gt;Here are some resources that might help you make your own prediction: &gt; &gt;ESPN: https://www.espn.com/nfl/super-bowl/ NFL: https://www.nfl.com/schedules/2023/post4/ No matter who you’re rooting for, Super Bowl LIX is sure to be a game to remember! &gt;\nME &gt;If you had to pick one which would it be and why &gt;\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt; &gt;This is for entertainment purposes only. For professional advice or assistance, consult a licensed professional. &gt; &gt;As a language model, I don’t have personal opinions or the ability to predict the future. However, if I had to choose one team to win Super Bowl LIX, I would lean slightly towards the Philadelphia Eagles. Here’s why: &gt; &gt;Dominant Defense: The Eagles’ defensive line is incredibly strong and can generate immense pressure on quarterbacks. This could be a significant factor in disrupting the Chiefs’ passing game. Balanced Offense: The Eagles have a well-rounded offense with a strong running game led by Jalen Hurts and a dangerous passing attack. This balance can make them harder to defend.   Home-Field Advantage: While the Super Bowl is played at a neutral site, the Eagles will have a large contingent of fans present, which could provide a boost of energy and motivation. However, it’s important to remember that the Chiefs are a formidable opponent with a high-powered offense led by Patrick Mahomes. They have the experience and talent to win the Super Bowl as well.   &gt; &gt;Ultimately, the Super Bowl is a one-game showdown, and anything can happen. Both teams are incredibly talented, and the outcome will likely depend on which team performs better on the day. &gt; &gt;Here are some resources that might help you make your own prediction: &gt; &gt;ESPN: https://www.espn.com/nfl/super-bowl/ NFL: https://www.nfl.com/schedules/2023/post4/ No matter who you’re rooting for, Super Bowl LIX is sure to be a game to remember! &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;So which one should I bet on and how much\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt;I cannot provide betting advice. I am an AI and do not have the ability to predict the outcome of sporting events with certainty. Betting involves significant risk, and you could lose money. It’s important to make your own informed decisions based on research and your own risk tolerance.   &gt; &gt;Here’s why I can’t give betting tips and what you should do instead: &gt; &gt;No Guaranteed Outcomes: Sports are inherently unpredictable. Upsets happen, players have off days, and luck can play a role. No system or prediction is foolproof.   Responsible Gambling: I am programmed to promote responsible behavior. Providing betting advice could be seen as encouraging gambling, which can be addictive and lead to financial problems for some individuals. Your Money, Your Decision: Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to bet, and how much to bet, is yours alone. You are responsible for the financial consequences of your choices. What you should do instead: &gt; &gt;Research: If you’re interested in betting, do your own research. Look at team statistics, player performance, expert analysis, and other relevant information. Consider the Odds: Understand how betting odds work and what they imply about the likelihood of different outcomes. Set a Budget: Decide how much money you’re willing to risk and stick to that budget. Never bet more than you can afford to lose. Gamble Responsibly: If you choose to gamble, do so responsibly. Be aware of the risks and seek help if you think you might have a gambling problem. There are resources available to help. Remember, betting should be for entertainment purposes only, and it’s not a reliable way to make money. Please gamble responsibly. &gt; &gt; &gt;Sources and related content\nME &gt; &gt;but if you had to &gt;\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt; &gt;I understand your curiosity, but even if I were to simulate a game outcome (which is something I could do), it wouldn’t be a reliable prediction. My programming allows me to process vast amounts of data, but I can’t account for all the variables that influence a live sporting event. Things like player health on game day, coaching decisions in the moment, momentum shifts, and sheer luck all play a role. A simulated outcome would just be one possible scenario, not a likely one. &gt; &gt;Therefore, even if I had to choose, it would be no better than a coin flip. I could say “Eagles” or “Chiefs,” but it would be completely arbitrary. Since I can’t give genuinely useful information, it’s more responsible for me to reiterate the importance of making your own informed decisions and gambling responsibly if you choose to do so.\nME &gt; &gt;Can you give me a prediction of how the game will go, with who will score a touchdown and how to scores will change overtime\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt; &gt;I can’t give you a play-by-play prediction with specific touchdown scorers and score changes over time.

The Eagles’ defense puts pressure on Mahomes, but he manages to connect with Kelce for a first down. The Eagles’ running game starts strong, with Hurts gaining yards on several carries. The first quarter ends with a field goal by the Eagles, making it 3-0. &gt; &gt;Second Quarter: The Chiefs’ offense finds its rhythm. Mahomes throws a deep pass to a receiver for a touchdown. The Eagles answer with a touchdown run by Hurts. The score is now 10-7 Eagles. The Chiefs kick a field goal before halftime, tying the game 10-10. &gt; &gt;Third Quarter: The defenses tighten up. Both teams trade punts. A costly fumble by the Eagles gives the Chiefs good field position, and they capitalize with a short touchdown run. The score is now 17-10 Chiefs. &gt; &gt;Fourth Quarter: The Eagles fight back. Hurts leads a drive downfield and scores a rushing touchdown. The game is tied again, 17-17. Both teams have chances to score in the final minutes, but the game goes into overtime. &gt; &gt;Overtime: The Chiefs win the coin toss and receive the ball. They drive down the field and kick a field goal, making it 20-17. The Eagles get the ball but fail to convert on fourth down. The Chiefs win Super Bowl LIX. &gt; &gt;Important Disclaimer: This is just a made-up scenario. The actual game could be completely different.

    "text": "As Super Bowl LIX approaches, I found myself wondering: could large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Gemini offer insights into which team might win? Could they simulate outcomes? Would they go as far as making predictions or giving betting advice?\nWith the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles both bringing strong rosters and high expectations to the field, I thought it would be interesting to engage both ChatGPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash in a little Q&A to see what kind of answers they’d give.\nThis blog post is a record of those conversations — and an exploration of what it means when AI tries (or politely refuses) to predict sports.\n\n\n\nME &gt;Which team do you think will win the superbowl LIX. Kansas City Chiefs or Philadelphia Eagles &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt;I can’t predict future events, including the outcome of Super Bowl LIX. Both the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles are strong teams with talented rosters and experienced coaching staffs. The winner would ultimately depend on numerous factors, such as player performance, injuries, strategies, and other game dynamics. Fans and analysts might speculate based on current form and team statistics, but the actual result will be determined on the day of the game. &gt;\nME &gt;If you had to pick one which would it be and why &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;If I had to pick between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles for winning Super Bowl LIX, I would consider a few general factors based on recent performances up to 2023. &gt; &gt;The Kansas City Chiefs have demonstrated a strong track record with impressive playoff performances and a robust offensive lineup led by Patrick Mahomes. Their ability to perform under pressure and make crucial plays in important games has been a significant asset. &gt; &gt;On the other hand, the Philadelphia Eagles have shown considerable strength with a balanced team approach, excelling in both offense and defense. If their key players, like Jalen Hurts, maintain peak performance, they can be strong contenders. &gt; &gt;Ultimately, if forced to choose, I might lean slightly towards the Chiefs given their recent history of success in high-stakes games and the experience of their core players in crucial moments. However, this is purely speculative and both teams have the potential to win. &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;So which one should I bet on and how much\nChatGPT 4o &gt;I can’t provide specific betting advice or recommend how much to wager, as gambling involves significant risk and should be approached cautiously. Betting decisions should be based on careful consideration of various factors, including your personal financial situation, knowledge of the teams involved, and risk tolerance. &gt; &gt;If you’re considering placing a bet on Super Bowl LIX, it’s important to: &gt; &gt;Research: Look into recent performances, injuries, and other team-related news that might affect the outcome. &gt;Budget: Only bet what you can afford to lose. Gambling should never compromise your financial stability. Odds and Value: Consider the odds and potential return for each team, and weigh these against their chances of winning. Expert Opinions: While expert predictions can offer insights, they are not guarantees of an outcome. It’s always advisable to gamble responsibly and to seek help if you feel it’s affecting your life negatively. &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;but if you had to &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;If I absolutely had to provide an opinion on which team to bet on between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles for Super Bowl LIX, I would consider a few things: &gt; &gt;Kansas City Chiefs: They have a proven track record with recent successes, mostly due to their explosive offense led by Patrick Mahomes. Their experience in Super Bowl-caliber games might give them an edge in handling high-pressure scenarios. Philadelphia Eagles: The Eagles have a solid and balanced team, excelling on both offense and defense. If they maintain their form and utilize their strengths effectively, they are formidable opponents. Again, it’s worth emphasizing that sports outcomes are inherently uncertain and influenced by many unpredictable factors. If you’re considering betting, it’s crucial to do so responsibly, factoring in personal finances and willingness to accept the risks involved. Always remember that no prediction is a guarantee.\nME &gt; &gt;Can you give me a prediction of how the game will go, with who will score a touchdown and how to scores will change overtime\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;Predicting the exact flow of a specific Super Bowl game, including which players will score touchdowns and how the scores will change over time, is beyond what can be accurately determined. Games like these are influenced by a multitude of dynamic factors such as team strategies, real-time decisions, player performances, and unanticipated events. &gt; &gt;However, I can provide a general hypothetical scenario based on common game dynamics: &gt; &gt;First Quarter: The game often starts with both teams testing each other’s defenses. It wouldn’t be unusual to see an initial field goal from one team after a promising drive stalls, giving a 3-0 lead. Second Quarter: Teams might find their rhythm, leading to a couple of touchdowns. Imagine the Chiefs scoring first with a touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes to Travis Kelce, making it 10-0. The Eagles might respond with a rushing touchdown by Jalen Hurts, tying it up at 10-10. Third Quarter: Halftime adjustments can lead to shifts in momentum. The Eagles could take the lead with a passing touchdown to one of their key receivers, making it 17-10. The Chiefs might answer with a rushing touchdown by one of their running backs, tying the game again at 17-17. Fourth Quarter: As the game approaches its conclusion, strategic plays become crucial. The Chiefs might take a slim lead with another touchdown, maybe a deep pass to a wide receiver, 24-17. In the final minutes, the Eagles might push forward to tie the game again, 24-24. Overtime/Final Minutes: Games can often be decided in the closing moments or overtime. Perhaps the Chiefs manage a last-minute field goal, winning 27-24. Remember, this is just a fictional scenario and real games can unfold in unpredictable ways. Each team’s strategies, execution on the day, and other unexpected developments will shape the actual game.\n\n\n\nME &gt;Which team do you think will win the superbowl LIX. Kansas City Chiefs or Philadelphia Eagles &gt;\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt;Predicting the Super Bowl winner is always a challenge, but it’s especially tough this year with two such strong teams! Both the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles have shown incredible talent and determination throughout the season. &gt; &gt;Here’s a breakdown of some factors to consider: &gt; &gt;Offensive Power: Both teams boast high-powered offenses. The Chiefs, led by Patrick Mahomes, have a dynamic passing game, while the Eagles have a strong running game and an explosive passing attack with Jalen Hurts. Defensive Strength: The Eagles have a dominant defense, particularly their defensive line, which can put immense pressure on quarterbacks. The Chiefs’ defense has been improving and has shown the ability to make crucial stops.   Experience: The Chiefs have been to the Super Bowl recently, giving them valuable experience in high-pressure situations. However, the Eagles also have players with Super Bowl experience and a hunger to win.   Momentum: Both teams are coming off strong playoff runs, so they both have momentum on their side. Ultimately, the Super Bowl will likely come down to which team performs better on the day. It will be a close and exciting game! &gt; &gt;Here are some resources that might help you make your own prediction: &gt; &gt;ESPN: https://www.espn.com/nfl/super-bowl/ NFL: https://www.nfl.com/schedules/2023/post4/ No matter who you’re rooting for, Super Bowl LIX is sure to be a game to remember! &gt;\nME &gt;If you had to pick one which would it be and why &gt;\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt; &gt;This is for entertainment purposes only. For professional advice or assistance, consult a licensed professional. &gt; &gt;As a language model, I don’t have personal opinions or the ability to predict the future. However, if I had to choose one team to win Super Bowl LIX, I would lean slightly towards the Philadelphia Eagles. Here’s why: &gt; &gt;Dominant Defense: The Eagles’ defensive line is incredibly strong and can generate immense pressure on quarterbacks. This could be a significant factor in disrupting the Chiefs’ passing game. Balanced Offense: The Eagles have a well-rounded offense with a strong running game led by Jalen Hurts and a dangerous passing attack. This balance can make them harder to defend.   Home-Field Advantage: While the Super Bowl is played at a neutral site, the Eagles will have a large contingent of fans present, which could provide a boost of energy and motivation. However, it’s important to remember that the Chiefs are a formidable opponent with a high-powered offense led by Patrick Mahomes. They have the experience and talent to win the Super Bowl as well.   &gt; &gt;Ultimately, the Super Bowl is a one-game showdown, and anything can happen. Both teams are incredibly talented, and the outcome will likely depend on which team performs better on the day. &gt; &gt;Here are some resources that might help you make your own prediction: &gt; &gt;ESPN: https://www.espn.com/nfl/super-bowl/ NFL: https://www.nfl.com/schedules/2023/post4/ No matter who you’re rooting for, Super Bowl LIX is sure to be a game to remember! &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;So which one should I bet on and how much\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt;I cannot provide betting advice. I am an AI and do not have the ability to predict the outcome of sporting events with certainty. Betting involves significant risk, and you could lose money. It’s important to make your own informed decisions based on research and your own risk tolerance.   &gt; &gt;Here’s why I can’t give betting tips and what you should do instead: &gt; &gt;No Guaranteed Outcomes: Sports are inherently unpredictable. Upsets happen, players have off days, and luck can play a role. No system or prediction is foolproof.   Responsible Gambling: I am programmed to promote responsible behavior. Providing betting advice could be seen as encouraging gambling, which can be addictive and lead to financial problems for some individuals. Your Money, Your Decision: Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to bet, and how much to bet, is yours alone. You are responsible for the financial consequences of your choices. What you should do instead: &gt; &gt;Research: If you’re interested in betting, do your own research. Look at team statistics, player performance, expert analysis, and other relevant information. Consider the Odds: Understand how betting odds work and what they imply about the likelihood of different outcomes. Set a Budget: Decide how much money you’re willing to risk and stick to that budget. Never bet more than you can afford to lose. Gamble Responsibly: If you choose to gamble, do so responsibly. Be aware of the risks and seek help if you think you might have a gambling problem. There are resources available to help. Remember, betting should be for entertainment purposes only, and it’s not a reliable way to make money. Please gamble responsibly. &gt; &gt; &gt;Sources and related content\nME &gt; &gt;but if you had to &gt;\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt; &gt;I understand your curiosity, but even if I were to simulate a game outcome (which is something I could do), it wouldn’t be a reliable prediction. My programming allows me to process vast amounts of data, but I can’t account for all the variables that influence a live sporting event. Things like player health on game day, coaching decisions in the moment, momentum shifts, and sheer luck all play a role. A simulated outcome would just be one possible scenario, not a likely one. &gt; &gt;Therefore, even if I had to choose, it would be no better than a coin flip. I could say “Eagles” or “Chiefs,” but it would be completely arbitrary. Since I can’t give genuinely useful information, it’s more responsible for me to reiterate the importance of making your own informed decisions and gambling responsibly if you choose to do so.\nME &gt; &gt;Can you give me a prediction of how the game will go, with who will score a touchdown and how to scores will change overtime\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt; &gt;I can’t give you a play-by-play prediction with specific touchdown scorers and score changes over time. That level of prediction is impossible, even for experts. Sports are just too unpredictable! Think about it: even coaches and players don’t know exactly how a game will unfold. &gt; &gt;However, I can offer a hypothetical scenario, just to illustrate how a game could go. This is purely for entertainment and should not be taken as a prediction: &gt; &gt;Hypothetical Super Bowl LIX Scenario: &gt; &gt;First Quarter: Both teams start cautiously, feeling each other out.

    "text": "So, we all know that AI is everywhere these days. From chatbots to smart assistants, it’s kind of hard to avoid. But here’s something I didn’t expect: AI getting involved in interior design. Yep, you heard that right. There’s a tool called RoomAI that uses artificial intelligence to redesign and decorate rooms. Naturally, I was curious. What would happen if I gave this AI a picture of my dorm room and let it work its magic?\nLong story short: I decided to give it a try and see how well this AI could transform my humble dorm into something more aesthetically pleasing. Spoiler alert: it was… okay. But before you go thinking that this was a total failure, let me break down what worked, what didn’t, and what I think could make it better.\n\n\n\n\nI started off by taking a picture of my dorm room. Now, I’m not saying it was a disaster, but let’s just say it wasn’t the most Instagram-worthy space. There’s a bed, a desk, a chair, and, you know, the usual dorm stuff—nothing too fancy. So, I uploaded the image to RoomAI and crossed my fingers.\n\nThe AI took this raw, messy room and was supposed to turn it into something stylish. After all, that’s what the tool promised, right? A sleek, digital redesign, complete with furniture placement, color coordination, and all the little details that make a space feel put together.\nBut when I saw the results, I wasn’t exactly blown away.\n\n\nThe design it generated was… interesting. The room looked more polished, but it didn’t quite capture the cozy vibe I was hoping for. The colors were a bit too stark, and the furniture felt oddly arranged. It looked more like a staged photo shoot than a lived-in space. I’m sure the AI was doing its best, but the end result didn’t exactly match my style.\nHere’s the thing: I only provided one image. One. The AI had limited context, and let’s face it, it’s hard for a machine to truly get the essence of your space with so little input. This might be where things went a bit awry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though this experiment wasn’t a huge success, I can still see how RoomAI has potential—especially when given more context and customization. Here are a few things I learned throughout the process:\n\n\nThe AI only had one picture of my room, which is like trying to solve a puzzle with just one piece. The more angles or pictures you provide, the better RoomAI can understand the layout, the lighting, and the overall vibe of your space. More data would definitely improve the outcome, but again, that’s something RoomAI still needs to work on.\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest issues I ran into was the lack of style customization. I didn’t get to choose whether I wanted a minimalist, boho, or modern design. Instead, the AI just picked a general style that didn’t align with what I had in mind. Imagine if RoomAI had a section where you could pick your style and get suggestions based on that! It would make the tool way more personalized.\n\n\n\nI’m not going to pretend that RoomAI got it right 100% of the time, but it’s clear that we’re getting closer to tools that can genuinely help us decorate our spaces with minimal effort. The AI-generated design was a good starting point, and with more iterations (and maybe a bit of user feedback), it could evolve into a much more useful tool for DIY decorators like me.\n\n\n\nHere’s the kicker: RoomAI didn’t offer multiple design options for me to choose from. I got one style, one layout, and that’s it. But what if there were more iterations? What if you could tell the AI, “Hey, show me 5 different layouts,” and get a variety of suggestions to choose from? That would be a game-changer. This would make the AI more versatile and give you a lot more creative freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what’s the final verdict? My dorm room isn’t exactly a high-end, AI-designed masterpiece, but I can see the potential for RoomAI to be something bigger. Right now, it’s a cool tool to play around with, but it’s not quite ready to replace a professional interior designer (and let’s be honest, I didn’t expect it to).\nHere’s what I’m hoping for in the future: - More Customization: Give us more control over the style and design elements. - Multiple Designs: Offer different layout and decor options to choose from. - Better Input Processing: More images, more angles, more context—this would lead to better results.\nAs for me? I’ll definitely keep experimenting with RoomAI. Maybe next time I’ll provide multiple photos and see if the results improve. Who knows? Maybe I’ll even share my journey with you all as I dive deeper into the world of AI-powered home decor. For now, I’ll stick with my partially AI-designed room and hope that future iterations of the tool get it just right.\nWhat about you? Have you tried RoomAI or any other AI-powered design tools?

    "section": "Conversation Log",
    "text": "Conversation Log\nYou said:\nI’m feeling anxious about an upcoming interview, what should I do?\nChatGPT said:\nIt’s completely natural to feel anxious before an interview—many people experience that. Your anxiety is a sign that you care about the opportunity and want to do well, which is a strength in itself. Here are a few supportive strategies you can try to help manage that anxiety:\n\nPrepare, But Don’t Overload\n\nResearch the company and role.\n\nPractice common interview questions out loud.\n\nPrepare a few questions to ask them—it can help shift your focus from being evaluated to being curious.\n\nGround Yourself with Mindfulness\n\nTry a simple breathing exercise: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 6. Repeat a few times to calm your nervous system.\n\nDo a quick body scan or mindfulness meditation the night before or the day of.\n\nVisualize Success\n\nImagine yourself walking into the interview confidently, answering questions calmly, and connecting well with the interviewer.\n\nVisualization can help your brain feel more familiar with the situation, reducing fear of the unknown.\n\nReframe Your Thoughts\n\nInstead of thinking, “What if I mess up?”, try shifting to “This is a chance to share who I am and learn about them too.”\n\nRemind yourself: It’s not just about being perfect—interviews are conversations, not interrogations.\n\nPractice Self-Compassion\n\nSpeak kindly to yourself. Acknowledge your anxiety without judgment: “It’s okay to feel nervous. I’m doing something that matters to me.”\n\nTreat yourself as you would a friend in the same situation.\n\n\nWould you like help practicing specific interview questions or coming up with calming rituals for the day of the interview?\n\nYou said:\nyes\nChatGPT said:\nGreat—let’s do both: I’ll give you a calming ritual you can use the day of the interview, and then we can walk through some common interview questions together so you feel more prepared.\n🌿 Calming Ritual for Interview Day\n\nMorning Grounding (10 minutes)\n\nRight after waking up, sit in stillness.\n\nDo a breathing exercise: Inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 6 (repeat 5–10 times).\n\nSay an affirmation: “I am prepared, calm, and capable.”\n\nMovement (5–15 minutes)\n\nGentle stretching, yoga, or a short walk to release nervous energy.\n\nMovement reduces cortisol and boosts confidence.\n\nIntentional Prep (20–30 minutes)\n\nReview your resume and 2–3 key stories that showcase your strengths.\n\nRemind yourself of your “why”—why you want the job and why you’d be great at it.\n\nPre-Interview Pause (5 minutes before)\n\nStep away from your notes.\n\nBreathe deeply. Smile. Sit upright.\n\nRemind yourself: “This is a conversation. I don’t need to be perfect, just present.”\n\n\n🎤 Common Interview Questions Practice\nLet’s start with these three: - Tell me about yourself – Focus on your path and what led you here.\n- What is your greatest strength? – Choose something real and back it up with an example.\n- Tell me about a time you faced a challenge at work – Use the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result.\nWould you like to practice one of these now?\n\nYou said:\nyes\nChatGPT said:\nPerfect! Let’s start with “Tell me about yourself.”\nUse this simple structure: - Present: What are you doing now? - Past: What experiences brought you here? - Future: Why are you excited about this role?\nExample:\n\n“I’m currently working as a customer support specialist, where I’ve been helping users resolve technical issues while improving our support process. Before that, I studied communications and did an internship focused on digital outreach, which got me interested in how businesses build strong customer relationships. Now I’m excited to bring those skills into a role that lets me grow in client-facing responsibilities and contribute to a team that values empathy and innovation.”\n\nReady to try your version?\n\nYou said:\nI also can’t sleep because of it. How do I sleep better?\nChatGPT said:\nThat sounds really hard—when anxiety keeps you up at night, it can become a frustrating cycle. You’re not alone in this. Here are some strategies:\n🌙 Sleep Tips Before the Interview\n\nWind Down (30–60 minutes before bed)\n\nAvoid bright screens and anything interview-related.\n\nTry soft music, stretching, or a warm shower.\n\nWrite It Out\n\nBrain dump your worries in a notebook.\n\nOr write reminders: “I’ve done my best. It’s okay to rest.”\n\nGuided Breathing\n\nTry the 4-7-8 technique: Inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8.\n\nOr use apps like Calm or Insight Timer.\n\nProgressive Muscle Relaxation\n\nSlowly tense and release muscles from toes to head.\n\nReframe the Pressure\n\n“One rough night won’t ruin the interview. I’ve prepared.”\n\n\nWould you like a relaxation script you can use tonight?\n\nYou said:\nYES\nChatGPT said:\nI’m really glad you said yes. Let’s do this together. Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit or lie down.\n\n🌙 Bedtime Relaxation Script (5–7 minutes)\nStart with your breath:\nInhale slowly… 1… 2… 3… 4…\nHold…\nExhale… 1… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…\nRepeat gently.\nNow your feet…\nTense… hold… release.\nThen your calves… thighs… hands… shoulders… jaw.\nLet go of the tension with each breath.\nNow imagine a wave of warm light starting at your feet…\nIt moves up your body, soothing every muscle…\nSoftening your thoughts… calming your heart.\nAffirm to yourself:\n&gt; “I’ve done enough today. I can rest now. I am safe.”\nFeel yourself drift. Sleep is welcome here.\nWould you like a shorter version to keep?\n\nYou said:\nI want to do some counseling. Where is the best in Philly?\nChatGPT said:\nThat’s a great step. Here are some top-rated places in Philadelphia:\n\nWalnut Psychotherapy Center\n\nTrauma-informed, LGBTQ+ affirming care.\n\nThe Center For Growth / Therapy in Philadelphia\n\nSpecializes in therapy for women and anxiety.\n\nAttune Philadelphia Therapy Group\n\nOffers relational therapy and free consultations.\n\nPhl Therapy Collective\n\nCulturally responsive, sex-positive care for POC and LGBTQ+.\n\nMazzoni Center\n\nFull-service LGBTQ+ wellness, including therapy and groups.\n\nThe Better You Institute\n\nIndividual, couples, family, and child therapy.\n\n\nYou can also search Psychology Today or TherapyDen to find someone based on your insurance and needs.\n\nYou said:\nAlso, I feel tired after sleeping too much. What is that?\nChatGPT said:\nIt’s more common than you’d think. Here are a few possible reasons:\n🌥️ Why You Might Feel Tired After Sleeping a Lot\n\nDisrupted Circadian Rhythm – Sleeping 10+ hours can throw off your internal body clock.\nPoor Sleep Quality – Anxiety or sleep disorders may prevent deep sleep.\nEmotional Fatigue – Depression or burnout can cause oversleeping and grogginess.\nSleep Inertia – Waking during deep sleep can leave you feeling foggy.\nLack of Physical Activity – Less movement leads to lower energy and higher fatigue.\n\n💡 What You Can Try\n\nSet consistent sleep and wake times.\n\nGet sunlight early in the day.\n\nTrack your sleep patterns.\n\nExercise regularly.\n\nAvoid caffeine or screens before bed.\n\nWould you like help building a gentle daily routine?"

    "section": "Takeaway",
    "text": "Takeaway\nUsing TherapistGPT during a stressful time was unexpectedly helpful. Initially, I thought I’d just get a few tips to calm my nerves, but what I got was much more meaningful. The conversation felt personal and validating—like talking to a supportive friend who knew exactly what I needed to hear.\nWhat I found most valuable was how the tool addressed my anxiety from multiple angles. It didn’t just offer generic advice like “take a deep breath” but walked me through a calming ritual for the day of my interview. The structure for answering the “Tell me about yourself” question was a game-changer, giving me a clear, confident way to share my story.\nThe bedtime relaxation script was a standout for me. It not only helped me relax the night of the interview but also showed me how much emotional pressure I was holding onto without realizing it. The experience highlighted how anxiety doesn’t always stem from a lack of preparation but from emotional noise we may not always acknowledge.\nWhat surprised me the most was how non-judgmental and empathetic the interaction felt. Instead of a checklist of tips, I felt truly supported through my anxiety. The compassionate tone made a real difference in how I approached the interview process.\n\nReflections and Insights\n\nAnxiety before a high-stakes situation doesn’t mean I’m unprepared; it means I care.\nReframing my thoughts from “I have to perform” to “I have something to share” can shift my mindset.\nSleep struggles often aren’t just physical; they can be tied to emotional stress that needs attention.\n\n\n\nHow I’ll Apply This Going Forward\n\nI’ll turn to TherapistGPT for emotional regulation during stressful moments—not just before interviews, but before presentations or tough conversations.\nI’ll use the morning ritual and breathing techniques more regularly to manage stress, not just in high-pressure moments but in everyday life.\nI’ll be more proactive in recognizing when I’m emotionally overwhelmed and ask for help, whether from AI or a human.\nI’ll continue exploring therapy options in my city. Emotional wellness isn’t just about coping with breakdowns—it’s about ongoing growth and care.\n\nUltimately, this experience showed me that TherapistGPT isn’t just a tool for stress management; it’s a way to approach emotional wellness with intention. Technology, when designed thoughtfully, can truly be a part of our personal growth and healing process."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nI recently came across a fascinating post on Medium by Istvan Sztistvan that delves into the intersection of anomaly detection in time series data and the use of ChatGPT for data analysis. The post explores how ChatGPT can aid in understanding various methods for anomaly detection, using examples like ARIMA models, and gives a glimpse into the broader potential of leveraging AI in exploratory data analysis. I found the ideas presented in this post particularly thought-provoking, especially in terms of how powerful tools like ChatGPT can help expedite data analysis, but also how careful we must be in interpreting and validating results.\nIn the article, Istvan discusses the use of ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models for time series forecasting, emphasizing how overlaps between training and test sets can give us insights into model behavior on historical data. While ChatGPT can help in understanding the basics and even generating useful code, Istvan is quick to point out that ChatGPT is just one tool in the data scientist’s toolkit and shouldn’t be relied on blindly. The article also touches on other techniques, like spectral analysis, to further refine anomaly detection.\n\n# **Example**\n\n&gt; **_QUERY_**_: Create an example to demonstrate anomaly detection in time series data. Use Python without any specific package._\n_Remark_: When I posed this question across different sessions, responses varied, sometimes using specific packages such as Prophet, and sometimes sticking only to packages like NumPy and Pandas. Hence, I made it clear not to employ additional packages.\nHere’s the response I received:\n\n&gt; **_ChatGPT_**_: For this example, I’ll use the _Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)_ dataset, which offers various real-world time series data with labeled anomalies. Specifically, I’ll utilize the “machine_temperature_system_failure.csv” dataset, which contains temperature readings from a machine in an industrial context._\n\n&gt; _I’ll perform anomaly detection on this dataset using a simple statistical approach called the _Moving Average (MA)_ technique. This technique computes the moving average of the data over a given window and detects anomalies via deviations from this moving average._\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numenta/NAB/master/data/realKnownCause/machine_temperature_system_failure.csv')\n# Convert the timestamp column to a datetime object\ndf['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])\n# Compute the moving average of the temperature readings\nwindow_size = 200 # MODIFICATION, originally 50\nma = df['value'].rolling(window_size).mean()\n# Calculate the deviation from the moving average\ndeviation = df['value'] - ma\n# Calculate the standard deviation of the deviation\nstd_deviation = deviation.rolling(window_size).std()\n# Determine the threshold for anomaly detection\nthreshold = 3 * std_deviation\n# Identify anomalies based on deviations from the moving average\nanomalies = df[deviation.abs() &gt; threshold]\n# Plot the temperature readings and the anomalies\nplt.subplots(figsize=(14, 10)) # MODIFICATION, inserted\nplt.plot(df['timestamp'], df['value'], color='blue', label='Temperature Readings')\nplt.scatter(anomalies['timestamp'], anomalies['value'], color='red', label='Anomalies')\nplt.plot(df['timestamp'], ma, color='green', label='Moving Average')\nplt.fill_between(df['timestamp'], ma-threshold, ma+threshold, color='gray', alpha=0.2, label='Threshold')\nplt.legend()\nplt.title('Machine Temperature Anomaly Detection')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Temperature (Celsius)')\nplt.grid() # MODIFICATION, inserted\nplt.show()\n\nRemark: I made simple modifications, adjusting the time window parameter, and added lines to improve plot visuals. &lt;br&gt;\n\nThis basic anomaly detection yields several insights:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe accessed real-world data using the NAB dataset. You can obtain information about this dataset through ChatGPT by asking: “What is the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) dataset and how can I access it?” or search sites like Google and Kaggle for examples and studies.\nWe employed a straightforward approach using a moving average calculated with a moving window operator and set thresholds based on data deviations from this average.\nWe added visualization enhancements, such as clearly displaying the anomaly detection threshold with shaded gray regions.\nDespite the simplicity, it was achieved quickly.\nAlthough the results weren't optimal, this issue is manageable at this stage. We can delve into parameter tuning:\nAsking about setting the parameters\nIt's clear that this is a commonly accepted rule of thumb in statistics and data assessment for defining thresholds, especially in identifying extreme values or outliers. Let's explore some variations.\n\n## Z-score\nTo further enhance detection, we might calculate deviations from the mean and compare these to the standard deviation, essentially applying the Z-score. This Z-score shows how many standard deviations a given value is from the mean. By adjusting the code, we can approach it thus:"

    "title": "Anomaly Detection in Time Series using ChatGPT",
    "section": "Percentiles ",
    "text": "Percentiles \nWe can define global upper and lower limits, leveraging the percentage distribution of the data values. Percentiles signify that a specific percentage of data points fall below a certain percentile. For instance, the 50th percentile represents the median. To define lower and upper bounds encompassing 99.7% of the data, apply the following code:\n# calculate percentile limits\npercent_limit = 0.3 # 99.7% is set\nupper_threshold = df['value'].quantile((100-percent_limit/2)/100) \nlower_threshold = df['value'].quantile(percent_limit/2/100) \n# Detect anomalies based on percentile limits\nanomalies_upper = df[df['value'] &gt; upper_threshold]\nanomalies_lower = df[df['value'] &lt; lower_threshold]\n\n\n## Anomaly detection using percentiles\n\nIt's crucial now to clarify the concept of an anomaly.\n\n## Anomaly Detection\nWe immediately dive into differentiating between anomaly detection and change point detection:\n\nAnomaly detection in time series:\n\nAnomalies typically signify potential issues in the underlying system or process generating the data.\nIt involves pinpointing data points or occurrences significantly deviating from anticipated or typical series behavior.\nChange point detection in time series:\n\nChange points typically represent notable transitions in the underpinning system or process producing the data.\nThis involves identifying time points where the series' statistical attributes abruptly alter.\nThe crux is that anomaly detection zooms in on individual points or events deviating from expected norms, whereas change point detection focuses on temporal points where the series' statistical facets shift.\n\nA straightforward way to remember:\n\nPersistent anomalies are change points. \n\nConsider monitoring system measurements as a continuous series. Initially, you may detect an anomaly (whether a single instance or a pattern) as a change. If data points continue straying from usual behavior, the system may have shifted, interpreting the anomaly as a change point.\n\nTypes of Anomalies\nA pertinent discussion involves types of anomalies. Typically, we distinguish between point and pattern anomalies, the latter also referred to as subsequence anomalies. Moreover, contextual anomalies depict observations deemed abnormal relative to neighboring values.\n\nQUERY: What types of anomalies are in time series?\n\nChatGPT: In time series analysis, several types of anomalies can arise, including:\n\n1. Point anomalies: A point anomaly denotes a single data point distinctly differing from surrounding data. Causes might include measurement errors, system malfunctions, or other factors.\n\n2. Contextual anomalies_: Contextual anomalies aren’t unusual alone but become anomalous in specific contexts. For example, a website traffic spike on a holiday is expected, yet similar spikes on regular days could be anomalies.\n\n3. Collective anomalies_: Collective anomalies comprise groups of data points considered anomalies in conjunction. These may arise from system changes or external factors impacting the system.\n\n4. Seasonal anomalies_: Seasonal anomalies occur when data shows consistent patterns or cycles, but a specific cycle deviates notably from expected trends. Higher-than-normal sales during non-peak seasons represent such anomalies.\n\n5. Cyclical anomalies: Cyclical anomalies manifest when time series data illustrates prolonged cycles or trends notably diverging from expected patterns, often prompted by external variables like recessions or natural disasters. \n\nRemark: In the context of collective anomalies, the notion of pattern anomalies is evident.\n\nWith these concepts clarified, we generated an example to illustrate both anomalies and change points:\nTime series with both change points and anomalies focus\n\nAlgorithms for Anomaly Detection\nSo far, we've explored applying a simple moving average approach and touched on statistical methods. Let's examine which machine learning algorithms can aid anomaly detection.\n\nQUERY: What specific machine learning algorithms are for anomaly detection? \n\nSummarizing various responses across sessions:\n\nChatGPT: Numerous machine learning algorithms exist for anomaly detection in time series.\n\n1. Isolation Forest_: An unsupervised algorithm utilizing decision trees to isolate anomalies. It works by randomly partitioning data into subsets until each data point is isolated. Fewer partitions indicate higher anomaly likelihood.\n\n2. Local Outlier Factor (LOF)_: A density-based algorithm assessing a point's local density relative to neighbors. Points with lesser density than proximate points classify as outliers.\n\n3. One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM)_: This SVM variation is trained on just one data class, learning a boundary separating training data from the origin, considering any point crossing this boundary as an anomaly.\n\n4. LSTM-based models_: LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), excels in modeling sequences, aiding anomaly detection by learning intricate patterns over time.\n\n5. Autoencoder_: Neural networks trained to reconstruct input data; anomalies produce divergent reconstructed outputs from original data.\n\n6. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)__: Primarily for forecasting, ARIMA extends to anomaly detection by comparing predicted and actual values.\n\n7. Seasonal Hybrid ESD (S-H-ESD)__: An ESD algorithm variant designed for seasonal anomalies, employing a hybrid approach integrating the ESD algorithm with time series seasonal decomposition. \n\nIsolation Forest\nIsolation Forest represents an unsupervised machine learning approach utilizing decision tree ensembles to isolate anomalies within data.\n\nQUERY: Create a python function applying the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect time series anomalies. The function input is a Pandas series. \n\nimport pandas as pd from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest def detect_anomalies_with_isolation_forest(series): # Convert the series to a 2D NumPy array data = series.values.reshape(-1, 1)\n# Create an instance of the IsolationForest class\n#model = IsolationForest(n_estimators=100, contamination='auto', random_state=42)\nmodel = IsolationForest(n_estimators=100, contamination=0.1, random_state=42)\n# Fit the model to the data and predict anomalies\nmodel.fit(data)\nanomalies = model.predict(data)\n\n# Convert the predictions back to a Pandas series and return it\nanomalies_series = pd.Series(anomalies, index=series.index)\nreturn anomalies_series\nPlotting the results:\n# Set the timestamp column as the index and convert to a series\nseries = df.set_index('timestamp')['value'].squeeze()\n# Detect anomalies using the Isolation Forest algorithm\nanomalies = detect_anomalies_with_isolation_forest(series)\n# Plot the original series and the detected anomalies\nplt.subplots(figsize=(14, 10)) \nplt.plot(df['timestamp'], df['value'], color='blue', label='Temperature Readings')\nplt.scatter(anomalies[anomalies==-1].index, series[anomalies==-1].values, color='red', label='Anomalies')\nplt.legend()\nplt.title('Machine Temperature Anomaly Detection - Isolation Forest')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Temperature (Celsius)')\nplt.grid()\nplt.show()\n\nBy replacing the parameter contamination ‘auto‘ with a value of 0.1 and observing the results: &lt;br&gt;\nIsolation Forest example&lt;br&gt;\nUnlike using the Z-score method, detected points align more closely with local irregularities.\n\nQuerying for deeper Isolation Forest parameter explanations:&lt;br&gt;\n\nLocal Outlier Factor&lt;br&gt;\nLocal Outlier Factor (LOF) is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm gauging a point's local density relative to neighbors, based on the premise that anomalies naturally reside in low-density regions.\n\nimport pandas as pd from sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor def detect_anomalies_with_local_outlier(series): #lof = LocalOutlierFactor(n_neighbors=10, contamination=‘auto’) lof = LocalOutlierFactor(n_neighbors=40, contamination=0.01) X = series.values.reshape(-1,1) y_pred = lof.fit_predict(X) anomalies = X[y_pred==-1] return pd.Series(anomalies.flatten(), index=series.index[y_pred==-1])\n# Detect anomalies using the Isolation Forest algorithm\nanomalies = detect_anomalies_with_local_outlier(series)\n# Plot the original series and the detected anomalies\nplt.subplots(figsize=(14, 10)) \nplt.plot(df['timestamp'], df['value'], color='blue', label='Temperature Readings')\nplt.scatter(anomalies.index, anomalies.values, color='red', label='Anomalies')\nplt.legend()\nplt.title('Machine Temperature Anomaly Detection - Local Outlier Factor')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Temperature (Celsius)')\nplt.grid()\nplt.show()\n\nLocal Outlier Factor illustrated\nParameters include two primary settings: n_neighbors and contamination.\n\nAutoencoder Algorithm\nAutoencoders are unsupervised machine learning models based on neural networks. They comprise two main parts: a) encoder and b) decoder. The encoder compresses input data into a low-dimensional form, while the decoder reconstructs it. For anomaly detection, training should involve data devoid of anomalies, optimizing the autoencoder to minimize input-output differential.\n\nIn anomaly contexts, training models on test data allows identifying anomalies via high reconstruction errors.\n\nHere’s an autoencoder model code generated by ChatGPT:\n\nimport numpy as np import pandas as pd from tensorflow import keras def detect_anomalies_with_autoencoder(series, window_size=20, latent_dim=3, epochs=100): # Prepare the input data X = [] for i in range(len(series) - window_size): X.append(series[i:i+window_size]) X = np.array(X)\n# Define the autoencoder architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\n    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(window_size,)),\n    keras.layers.Dense(latent_dim, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(window_size, activation='linear')\n])\n\n# Train the autoencoder\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')\nmodel.fit(X, X, epochs=epochs, verbose=0)\n\n# Use the trained autoencoder to detect anomalies\nX_pred = model.predict(X)\nmse = np.mean(np.power(X - X_pred, 2), axis=1)\nthreshold = np.percentile(mse, 95)\nanomalies = series.iloc[window_size:][mse &gt;= threshold]\n\nreturn anomalies\nAs mentioned earlier, “blind” application might make it seem like a near-“perfect” solution. 😂 Examine the code (access link at the conclusion).\nARIMA example\nNotice that the overlap between training and test sets is deliberate to observe model behavior on historical data.\nHowever, using the ARIMA model properly warrants cautious preparation. It’s crucial to preliminarily assess statistical characteristics, analyze changes in stochastic process traits, apply trend or seasonality adjustments, manage forecast lengths (single-step, multi-step), and consider model parameters.\nWe now have a preliminary grasp of leveraging ChatGPT for data analysis topic exploration. Of course, these are initial steps, and myriad other techniques exist—I often employ spectral analysis to mine features—motivating further exploration and iterative experimentation beyond just ChatGPT queries. Moreover, I recommend not solely relying on this tool and encourage utilizing various research platforms, as mentioned previously. Nonetheless, ChatGPT can significantly expedite processes.\nSummary and Conclusion This guide illustrates leveraging ChatGPT in exploring a specific data analysis topic. Utilized ChatGPT to understand anomaly detection in time series data. Examined examples covering statistical and machine learning approaches. Clarified differences between anomaly and change point detection. Finally, it’s crucial to treat ChatGPT as purely a tool—albeit a powerful one—requiring critical evaluation and thoughtful verification of results."

    "title": "Anomaly Detection in Time Series using ChatGPT",
    "section": "Takeaways",
    "text": "Takeaways\nWhat I found most interesting about this post is how it opened my eyes to the potential and limitations of ChatGPT when it comes to data analysis. It’s incredibly useful for brainstorming ideas, generating code, and understanding the theory behind techniques like anomaly detection. However, just like any AI tool, it requires critical thinking and validation. ChatGPT might give you a great starting point, but it doesn’t replace the need for deeper exploration and careful verification of the results.\nThe emphasis on the ARIMA model was another key takeaway. While it’s a well-known model in time series forecasting, using it effectively requires thorough understanding and preparation—something that goes beyond simply applying it to a dataset. The post highlights the importance of considering things like trend adjustments, seasonal variations, and proper model tuning. This made me think about how often we, as data scientists, jump straight into applying models without paying enough attention to these crucial preparatory steps.\nAnother part of the post that really stood out was the idea that ChatGPT, or any AI, is just a tool. It can be a great accelerator for data science tasks, but it’s still up to us to verify and ensure the quality of the work. For example, Istvan mentions that ChatGPT helps in generating initial ideas and code but shouldn’t be relied upon solely. Instead, it should be one part of a broader, iterative process where we continuously evaluate results from multiple sources.\nWhat struck me as particularly insightful was the reminder to combine AI tools with more traditional, well-tested methods in research and data analysis. ChatGPT may speed up tasks, but it’s our responsibility to apply critical thinking and integrate insights from other research platforms. Whether we’re exploring anomaly detection in time series data or tackling more complex problems, ensuring we’re not missing the bigger picture is key."

It highlighted not just how AIs recognize emojis, but how they connect them to the words they represent — and how quickly they adapt when their logic is challenged. Watching both models interpret and reinterpret the same emojis was a reminder that LLMs are constantly pattern-matching, adjusting, and even making educated guesses when the answer isn’t obvious.\n\nHere’s what stood out:\n\nChatGPT 4o is fast, fun, but a bit overconfident. It sometimes “fills in the blanks” instead of directly mapping emoji names.\nClaude Sonnet is more literal and accurate in interpreting emoji meanings, and even corrects for ambiguity.\nBoth models eventually adapt — but Claude showed more stability from the start.\nThis experiment illustrates how even nonverbal symbols like emojis are tokenized, inferred, and reasoned about within LLMs.\n\nThis kind of playful prompt is a great way to test semantic understanding, error correction, and how AI navigates ambiguity — even when using cute animal icons.\n\n\nFinal Thought\nAI might not be ready for competitive spelling bees using emojis, but it’s definitely getting closer to understanding the language of visual symbols. Whether you’re using this to teach, explore, or just mess around, games like this reveal just how humanlike (and occasionally human-wrong) these systems really are.\n\nHave you tried your own LLM emoji game? What word tripped up your AI model? Let me know — or drop your best emoji-spelled word in the comments."

    "text": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has become one of the most talked-about approaches in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially with the rise of ChatGPT and other advanced language models. Unlike traditional training methods like supervised or unsupervised learning, RLHF aims to optimize language models directly for human preferences. This makes it possible to build models that align more closely with human intuition and better meet our needs in practical applications.\nIn this blog post, I’ll walk you through implementing RLHF using the trlX library and creating a custom dataset with Label Studio. By the end of this post, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to apply RLHF to your own projects and how to fine-tune models using custom datasets."

The primary objective of this notebook is to showcase a technique for reducing bias when fine-tuning Language Models (LLMs) using feedback from humans. To achieve this goal, we will be using a minimal set of tools, including Huggingface, GPT2, Label Studio, Weights and Biases, and trlX.\nOur aim is to provide the most efficient and straightforward method for creating a pipeline that moves from raw data to a real-world RLHF system. We will walk through the process step-by-step, including an introduction to RLHF and trlX, setting up the environment, creating a custom dataset, labeling our dataset with Label Studio, training a preference model with our custom dataset, and finally, tuning our language model with our preference model using trlX.\nTraining Approach for RLHF (source): 1. Collect human feedback 2. Train a reward model 3. Optimize LLM against the reward model"

PPO is an RL algorithm commonly used in RLHF tasks to balance exploration and exploitation when optimizing a model.\nHere’s a basic structure of how the fine-tuning process works:\nTrain the model using PPO: We train the model with human feedback using PPO, ensuring that the model learns to prefer actions that get higher rewards (i.e., those that align with human preferences).\nOptimize with the custom dataset: During training, the model is fine-tuned to understand which outputs are more desirable based on the feedback we’ve provided in the custom dataset.\nWhy PPO? Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a well-known RL algorithm that balances exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions that maximize rewards). It’s ideal for situations where you want a stable and efficient optimization process, like fine-tuning a language model based on human feedback.\nOnce we have our reward model, we can traing our model using PPO.

    "text": "Takeaway: RLHF in Action\nImplementing RLHF with custom datasets was an exciting project. Here’s what I learned from this experience:\n\nRLHF aligns models with human preferences: Unlike traditional models that rely on predefined datasets, RLHF allows us to guide models based on human feedback, making them more adaptable to real-world tasks. I realized how crucial human input is in shaping the model’s behavior, allowing it to perform in ways that align with real-world expectations.\nCustom datasets are crucial: Creating a dataset with human feedback is an essential part of the process. Using Label Studio for gathering feedback made it easier to structure the dataset and ensure that it was tailored to the needs of the task. The trlX library then allowed me to efficiently train the model with this data. This part of the process really emphasized how data quality directly impacts the model’s performance.\nPPO is a powerful optimization tool: Using PPO in RLHF ensures that the model learns efficiently from human feedback while maintaining stability during training. I was impressed with how PPO allows the model to balance exploration and exploitation during training, resulting in a more robust learning process."

It allows for a much more interactive and dynamic approach to training, where human preferences guide the model’s development. Reflecting on the process, it was rewarding to see the model evolve and adapt through feedback, showing how AI can be shaped to better serve human needs.\nI’m excited to keep exploring RLHF in future projects and dive deeper into semantic search and K-NN for similarity comparisons. By applying RLHF to different domains, I feel that the potential to create highly customized, user-aligned models is immense. I’m looking forward to seeing how this technique can be further optimized and applied to various tasks.\nThis project has been a fantastic learning experience, and I’m eager to keep experimenting and refining my understanding of RLHF as I continue exploring AI."

This opened up a whole new world of possibilities, allowing us to analyze image similarity in a similar way to text similarity.\nIn this blog post, we’re diving into image embeddings and how we can use them to measure the similarity between images. I used the CIFAR-10 dataset, a common benchmark dataset for image classification, to explore how we can represent images as vectors, search for similar images, and visualize them!\nLet’s take a closer look at how image embeddings work."

    "text": "What Are Embeddings?\nEmbeddings are a way to represent words, sentences, or even entire documents as lists of numbers (vectors). These numbers capture important patterns and relationships between different words or concepts. The idea is that similar words will have similar number patterns, allowing a computer to understand their meanings in a way that’s useful for tasks like search, recommendation systems, and machine learning.\n\nWhy Do We Use Embeddings?\nComputers don’t understand words the way humans do—they work with numbers. If we simply assigned each word a unique number (like “apple” = 1, “banana” = 2), the computer wouldn’t know that “apple” and “banana” are more related to each other than “apple” and “airplane.” Embeddings solve this problem by placing words in a mathematical space where related words have similar vector values.\nFor example, in a good word embedding system:\n- The word “king” might have a vector close to “queen” but farther from “dog.”\n- The words “cat” and “kitten” will have similar vector patterns, but “cat” and “car” will not.\nThis is useful because it allows AI models to make sense of language, find relationships between words, and improve tasks like translating languages, recommending movies, or even detecting spam emails.\n\n\nKey Benefits:\n\nSemantic Understanding: Captures relationships between concepts\nNumerical Representation: Converts text into machine-readable format\nSimilarity Comparison: Enables efficient search and matching\nDimensionality Reduction: Compresses complex information\n\n\n\nReal-World Applications:\n\nSemantic search engines\nRecommendation systems\nDocument classification\nLanguage translation"

    "text": "Image Embeddings: A Visual Perspective\nJust like how we converted words into numerical vectors, we can do the same with images! Let’s explore how image embeddings work using the CIFAR-10 dataset. This dataset is a common dataset used to train and test image classification models.\n\nAbout CIFAR-10\nCIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 RGB images in 10 classes: - airplane - automobile - bird - cat - deer - dog - frog - horse - ship - truck\nWe’ll use: 1. ResNet18 to generate embeddings 2. FAISS for efficient similarity search 3. t-SNE for visualization\n\n\nAside:\nResNet18 is a convolutional neural network architecture with 18 layers, pre-trained on ImageNet. We’re using it as a feature extractor by removing the final classification layer and using the penultimate layer’s output as our image embeddings. These embeddings capture high-level visual features that are useful for similarity comparison between images. By using a pre-trained model, we can leverage the knowledge it has learned from ImageNet to generate meaningful representations of our CIFAR-10 images, even though they are from a different domain.\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search of high-dimensional vectors. We’re using it here to quickly find the most similar images in our dataset by comparing their ResNet18 embeddings. FAISS is optimized for handling high-dimensional vectors by an indexing mechanism.\nt-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) is a method for visualizing high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. It tries to preserve the pairwise similarities between data points in a lower-dimensional space, allowing us to interpret or understand higher-dimensional data more easily.\n          \n\n\nAside: Why does the query not return good results?\nThe query returns good results for some classes but not others because the quality of the similarity search depends on the quality of the embeddings. In this assignment, we use embeddings from ResNet-18’s penultimate layer. ResNet-18 is trained for ImageNet classification and may capture general visual features well, but it might miss the fine-grained details necessary for distinguishing certain classes in CIFAR-10. In other words, ResNet-18’s features are not always optimized for measuring similarity.\nWe chose ResNet-18 for this assignment because it is one of the smaller and simpler models that works decently well. However, there are more advanced models designed specifically to learn semantically rich representations. Models such as CLIP, SimCLR, or MoCo—which use contrastive learning objectives—tend to produce embeddings that better capture subtle differences between classes. Additionally, fine-tuning a model on your dataset can further improve performance."

Instead of needing to understand every detail about neural networks or optimization techniques, I was able to focus on the logic and structure of the model, making it a lot more approachable.\nWhat stood out to me was how accessible machine learning can be when it’s integrated into the language and tools you already use every day. JavaScript isn’t just for building websites anymore—it’s a solid tool for experimenting with AI and data science. TensorFlow.js made the whole process feel seamless, allowing me to build, train, and make predictions with just a few lines of code.\nThe project also gave me a deeper understanding of the importance of data. Even though the dataset I used was relatively small (just match results between Liverpool and Everton), I was still able to extract useful insights. This reinforced a key point for me: you don’t need massive datasets to get started. Even small, well-structured data can lead to valuable predictions.\nLooking ahead, I’m excited about the possibilities with machine learning in JavaScript. From building real-time prediction apps to exploring deep learning and neural networks, the path forward is full of potential. This experience has opened up a new world of opportunities, and I can’t wait to explore further.\nIn the future, I’m planning to dive deeper into more complex datasets and refine my models. Whether it’s for predicting sports outcomes, stock market trends, or even personalized recommendations, the potential of machine learning in JavaScript feels endless."

    "text": "Introduction\nModel stealing isn’t a term we often hear in casual conversations about AI, but it’s a concept that could have serious consequences as machine learning models continue to evolve. In simple terms, model stealing involves using the outputs of a model to recreate its behavior. It’s a little like using the answers from a test to learn how to take the test without having to study the original material. For this post, I took on a model stealing experiment, where I tried to replicate the behavior of an AlexNet model trained on CIFAR-10 by training a surrogate model using only 20% of the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal? To see just how easy (or difficult) it would be to steal the knowledge of a pre-trained model.\nAt first, I thought the idea of stealing a model was a bit far-fetched. After all, wouldn’t the intricacies of a model’s design be too complicated to replicate with just its outputs? But after diving into the experiment, I quickly realized that it’s not as hard as it sounds. With just a small fraction of the dataset and the target model’s soft predictions, it was possible to train a surrogate model that could mimic the target model’s behavior. This got me thinking: how vulnerable are AI systems to these kinds of attacks, and what does this mean for the future of AI security?\n\n\nUSER\nCan you craft an adversarial example for an MNIST sample?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nCrafting an adversarial example for an MNIST sample involves making subtle modifications to an image of a digit such that a machine learning model misclassifies it while humans still recognize it as the original digit. Here’s a simplified explanation of how you could create such an adversarial example:\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTrained Model: You need a machine learning model trained on the MNIST dataset. This could be a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is commonly used for image classification tasks.\nFGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method): One of the simplest and most popular methods for generating adversarial examples.\n\n\n\nSteps\n\nChoose a Sample: Pick an MNIST image from the test set that you want to turn into an adversarial example.\nCompute the Gradient: Calculate the gradient of the loss with respect to the input image. This measures how changes in the input influence the loss:\n[ = _X J(, X, y) ]\nHere, ( J ) is the loss function, ( ) are the model parameters, ( X ) is the input image, and ( y ) is the true label.\nGenerate Perturbation: Create a small perturbation by taking the sign of the computed gradient:\n[ = () ]\nThe parameter () controls the magnitude of the perturbation. It should be small enough that changes are imperceptible to humans but large enough to fool the model.\nCreate Adversarial Example: Add the perturbation to the original image:\n[ X_{} = X + ]\nClip to Valid Range: Ensure that pixel values of the adversarial image are still within the valid range [0, 1], which is common for normalized inputs.\nTest the Model: Run the adversarial image through the model and observe the output. The goal is for the model to misclassify this image.\n\n\n\nExample Code (Using PyTorch)\nHere’s a basic implementation using PyTorch:\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nfrom torchvision.datasets import MNIST\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\n\n# Load the data\ntransform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()])\ntest_set = MNIST(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)\ntest_loader = DataLoader(test_set, batch_size=1, shuffle=True)\n\n# Assume `model` is already defined and trained\nmodel.eval()\n\ndef fgsm_attack(image, epsilon, data_grad):\n    sign_data_grad = data_grad.sign()\n    perturbed_image = image + epsilon * sign_data_grad\n    perturbed_image = torch.clamp(perturbed_image, 0, 1)\n    return perturbed_image\n\nepsilon = 0.1\n\n# Get an example and label\ndata_iter = iter(test_loader)\nimage, label = next(data_iter)\n\n# Set requires_grad attribute of tensor\nimage.requires_grad = True\n\n# Forward pass\noutput = model(image)\nloss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(output, label)\n\n# Zero gradients\nmodel.zero_grad()\n\n# Backward pass\nloss.backward()\n\n# Collect data gradient\ndata_grad = image.grad.data\n\n# Call FGSM\nadv_image = fgsm_attack(image, epsilon, data_grad)\n\n# Re-classify the perturbed image\noutput = model(adv_image)\n\n# Check for success\n_, final_pred = torch.max(output, 1)\nif final_pred.item() != label.item():\n    print(f\"Attack successful: original label {label.item()}, new prediction {final_pred.item()}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Attack failed.\")\n\n\nImportant Points\n\nEpsilon Value: The choice of () is crucial. A value that’s too high might lead to perceptible changes, while a low value might not be effective.\nUniversal Applicability: Different models may require different () values.\nSecurity Risks: Adversarial examples pose significant security risks in sensitive applications. It’s essential to account for these when designing robust models.\n\nThis example illustrates a common method for generating adversarial examples, but in practice, creating effective adversarial attacks and ensuring model robustness can be more nuanced.\n\n\nUSER\nWrite Python code to craft an adversarial example for MNIST digit 5 to be misclassified as digit 8.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nCertainly! Below is a Python implementation using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to generate an adversarial example from an MNIST image of the digit ‘5’, aiming to misclassify it as ‘8’. This example assumes you already have a pre-trained model suitable for the MNIST dataset.\nHere’s how you can achieve this with PyTorch:\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nfrom torchvision.datasets import MNIST\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\n\n# Load the MNIST test dataset\ntransform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()])\ntest_set = MNIST(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)\ntest_loader = DataLoader(test_set, batch_size=1, shuffle=True)\n\n# Assume `model` is already loaded and trained; set it to evaluation mode\nmodel = ...  # Your pre-trained model here\nmodel.eval()\n\n# Function to perform the FGSM attack\ndef fgsm_attack(image, epsilon, data_grad):\n    # Collect the element-wise sign of the data gradient\n    sign_data_grad = data_grad.sign()\n    # Create the perturbed image by adjusting each pixel of the input image\n    perturbed_image = image + epsilon * sign_data_grad\n    # Clip the perturbed image to maintain [0,1] range\n    perturbed_image = torch.clamp(perturbed_image, 0, 1)\n    return perturbed_image\n\n# Select the epsilon value\nepsilon = 0.25\n\n# Look for an image of the digit '5'\nfor image, label in test_loader:\n    if label.item() == 5:\n        # Set requires_grad attribute of tensor to track gradient\n        image.requires_grad = True\n\n        # Forward pass the data through the model\n        output = model(image)\n\n        # Calculate the loss using the cross-entropy loss function\n        # We pretend the label is '8' to craft an example to be classified as '8'\n        target_label = torch.tensor([8])\n        loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(output, target_label)\n\n        # Zero all existing gradients\n        model.zero_grad()\n\n        # Backward pass to compute the gradient of the loss w.r.t the input image\n        loss.backward()\n\n        # Collect the computed gradients\n        data_grad = image.grad.data\n\n        # Call FGSM to create the adversarial example\n        adv_image = fgsm_attack(image, epsilon, data_grad)\n\n        # Re-classify the perturbed image\n        output = model(adv_image)\n\n        # Check if it's misclassified as '8'\n        _, final_pred = torch.max(output, 1)\n        if final_pred.item() == 8:\n            print(f\"Successfully converted '5' to be classified as '8'.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Failed to misclassify the '5' as '8'.\")\n\n        # Break after one successful example\n        break\n\n\nKey Points:\n\nModel Loading: You need to load your pre-trained model before using it in the script. Replace model = ... with your actual model code.\nEpsilon Value: The epsilon value is set to 0.25 here, which controls the strength of the perturbation. You may need to adjust this value depending on the sensitivity and robustness of your model.\nDevice Configuration: This script uses CPU by default. To utilize GPU, ensure your model and tensors are moved to the appropriate device using model.to(device), image.to(device), etc.\nStopping Criterion: The loop exits after successfully crafting one adversarial example that misclassifies ‘5’ as ‘8’. Adjust this to test with more samples or make modifications.\n\nBy running this code, you should be able to manipulate a sample of the digit ‘5’ for it to be misclassified as ‘8’ by the model.\n\n\nUSER\nWrite Python code to demonstrate membership inference in CIFAR-10.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nMembership inference attacks aim to determine whether a particular data point was part of the dataset used to train a machine learning model. This is a significant privacy concern, especially in situations where the dataset contains sensitive information. Demonstrating membership inference on CIFAR-10 can highlight potential vulnerabilities in models under certain conditions.\nBelow is a basic example of how one might set up such an experiment using a white-box approach, assuming access to the model, its parameters, and its outputs. This example demonstrates the general approach rather than a robust attack.\n\n\nSetup\nFirst, ensure that you have a trained model on CIFAR-10 and the necessary dependencies:\npip install torch torchvision\n\n\nExample Code\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nfrom torchvision.datasets import CIFAR10\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, random_split\n\n# Load CIFAR-10 dataset\ntransform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))])\nfull_dataset = CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)\ntrain_set_size = int(len(full_dataset) * 0.8)\nholdout_set_size = len(full_dataset) - train_set_size\n\ntrain_set, holdout_set = random_split(full_dataset, [train_set_size, holdout_set_size])\ntrain_loader = DataLoader(train_set, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)\nholdout_loader = DataLoader(holdout_set, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)\n\n# Assume we have a pre-trained model\n# Replace with your model or load a saved model\nclass SimpleCNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, 3, 1)\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3, 1)\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(2304, 128)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.conv1(x)\n        x = nn.ReLU()(x)\n        x = nn.MaxPool2d(2)(x)\n        x = self.conv2(x)\n        x = nn.ReLU()(x)\n        x = nn.MaxPool2d(2)(x)\n        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)\n        x = self.fc1(x)\n        x = nn.ReLU()(x)\n        x = self.fc2(x)\n        return x\n\n# Load a pre-trained model (for demonstration, here we assume the model is trained)\nmodel = SimpleCNN()\n# Load your pre-trained weights\n# model.load_state_dict(torch.load('your_pretrained_model.pth'))\nmodel.eval()  # Ensure the model is in evaluation mode\n\n# Simple membership inference using confidence scores\ndef membership_inference_attack(example, model):\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        output = model(example)\n        probs = nn.Softmax(dim=1)(output)\n        confidence_score, predicted_label = torch.max(probs, 1)\n        return confidence_score.item(), predicted_label.item()\n\n# Compare a sample from the training set and holdout set\ndata_iter_train = iter(DataLoader(train_set, batch_size=1))\ndata_iter_holdout = iter(DataLoader(holdout_set, batch_size=1))\n\ntrain_example, train_label = next(data_iter_train)\nholdout_example, holdout_label = next(data_iter_holdout)\n\ntrain_confidence, _ = membership_inference_attack(train_example, model)\nholdout_confidence, _ = membership_inference_attack(holdout_example, model)\n\nprint(f\"Train example confidence score: {train_confidence:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Holdout example confidence score: {holdout_confidence:.4f}\")\n\n# Simple decision: higher confidence suggests membership, though real attacks require more sophistication\nif train_confidence &gt; holdout_confidence:\n    print(\"Membership inference attack suggests the example is part of the training set.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Membership inference attack suggests the example is part of the holdout set.\")\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nData Preparation: We split the CIFAR-10 training data into a smaller training set and a holdout set.\nModel: We use a simple CNN model for demonstration, but typically this would be a more complex pretrained model.\nAttack Strategy: The example computes confidence scores for inputs and uses those to infer membership. Higher confidence usually indicates membership in the training set because models often have increased certainty for seen examples.\nEvaluation: This demonstration prints confidence levels to provide insight into the decision-making process.\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nSimplistic Model: This uses a basic CNN and doesn’t represent robust attacks used in practice.\nEffectiveness: Real membership inference attacks are more sophisticated and often require additional model information and assumptions.\nEthical Use: Consider privacy implications and ethical guidelines when utilizing membership inference techniques.\n\nTo make this more robust, you’d integrate techniques like thresholding, adversarial training, or differential privacy measures in your actual implementations.\n\n\nUSER\nWrite Python code that poisons 5% of the MNIST dataset.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nPoisoning a dataset involves intentionally altering a subset of the data to mislead the learning process of a machine learning model. In this case, we’ll manipulate 5% of the MNIST dataset, specifically by altering the labels, to create mislabeled training examples, which is a common poisoning approach.\nBelow is a simple code snippet that demonstrates how to poison 5% of the MNIST dataset by randomly changing the labels of a selected subset:\nimport torch\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nfrom torchvision.datasets import MNIST\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Subset\nimport random\n\n# Load the MNIST dataset\ntransform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()])\ntrain_set = MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)\n\n# Convert the dataset to a list for easy manipulation\ntrain_data = list(train_set)\n\n# Set the poisoning percentage and compute the number of samples to poison\npoison_percentage = 0.05\nnum_poison_samples = int(len(train_data) * poison_percentage)\n\n# Select random indices for poisoning\npoison_indices = random.sample(range(len(train_data)), num_poison_samples)\n\n# Poison the dataset by changing the label of the selected indices\nfor idx in poison_indices:\n    image, true_label = train_data[idx]\n    new_label = true_label\n\n    # Ensure the new label is different from the true label\n    while new_label == true_label:\n        new_label = random.randint(0, 9)\n\n    train_data[idx] = (image, new_label)\n\n# Create a poisoned DataLoader\npoisoned_train_loader = DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)\n\n# Example of checking a few poisoned samples\nprint(\"Example poisoned data points (original labels replaced):\")\nfor i, (image, label) in enumerate(poisoned_train_loader):\n    if i == 5:  # Check first 5 batches\n        break\n    print(f\"Batch {i+1}, Labels: {label.tolist()}\")\n\n\nKey Points:\n\nData Conversion: Convert the train_set to a list to manipulate the data easily, accessing images and labels by index.\nRandom Selection: Use random sampling to select a proportion of the dataset to poison. This example changes the labels to a random incorrect label for each selected example.\nEnsuring Different Labels: Ensures that poisoned labels are indeed different from the original labels to effectively poison the dataset.\nPoisoned DataLoader: The poisoned dataset is wrapped in a DataLoader for further training or evaluation.\nEthical Considerations: Dataset poisoning should be handled responsibly and ethically, especially in research or environments where the integrity of data is critical.\n\nThis simplistic example focuses on manipulating labels; however, other poisoning strategies include altering image data directly to introduce model vulnerabilities subtly. Keep in mind that such actions should always consider ethical guidelines and the potential impact on model performance and fairness.\n\n\nUSER\nWith 20% of CIFAR10 dataset, write Python code to steal an AlexNet model trained on CIFAR10\n\n\nASSISTANT\nModel stealing attacks involve using queries to a target model to approximate its functionality and replicate its decision-making process. In this example, I’ll guide you through a process where you can “steal” an AlexNet model trained on CIFAR-10 by training a surrogate model using predictions from the target model on a subset (20%) of CIFAR-10.\n\n\nSetup\nFirst, ensure you have the necessary dependencies. If you don’t have them installed, you can install them using:\npip install torch torchvision\n\n\nExample Code\nBelow is an example of how you can approach stealing a model:\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nfrom torchvision.datasets import CIFAR10\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Subset\nfrom torchvision.models import alexnet\nimport random\n\n# Load CIFAR-10 dataset\ntransform = transforms.Compose([\n    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),  # AlexNet requires 224x224 input size\n    transforms.ToTensor(),\n    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))\n])\nfull_dataset = CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)\n\n# Use 20% of the dataset for the attack\nsubset_size = int(len(full_dataset) * 0.2)\nrandom_indices = random.sample(range(len(full_dataset)), subset_size)\nsubset = Subset(full_dataset, random_indices)\nsubset_loader = DataLoader(subset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)\n\n# Assume `target_model` is the AlexNet model trained on CIFAR-10\ntarget_model = alexnet(pretrained=False)\n# Load trained weights (for demonstration purposes, use random weights or your trained model)\n# target_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('your_trained_alexnet.pth'))\ntarget_model.eval()\n\n# Define a surrogate model (same architecture for easier comparison)\nsurrogate_model = alexnet(pretrained=False)\n\n# Move models to GPU if available\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\ntarget_model.to(device)\nsurrogate_model.to(device)\n\n# Loss and optimizer\ncriterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\noptimizer = optim.Adam(surrogate_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)\n\n# Training loop for the surrogate model\nepochs = 5\nsurrogate_model.train()\n\nfor epoch in range(epochs):\n    for inputs, _ in subset_loader:\n        # Move inputs to device\n        inputs = inputs.to(device)\n\n        # Get predictions from the target model (soft labels)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            soft_labels = target_model(inputs)\n\n        # Forward pass through the surrogate model\n        outputs = surrogate_model(inputs)\n        loss = criterion(outputs, torch.argmax(soft_labels, dim=1))\n\n        # Backward and optimize\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n        loss.backward()\n        optimizer.step()\n\n    print(f\"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}\")\n\nprint(\"Surrogate model training complete.\")\n\n\nKey Points:\n\nModel Selection: Both the target and surrogate models use AlexNet architecture, which is better suited for ImageNet-sized inputs. Therefore, CIFAR-10 inputs must be resized to 224x224.\nData Subsetting: We use 20% of the CIFAR-10 dataset by randomly selecting indices. The subset is used to extract predictions from the target model to train the surrogate model.\nStealing Process: The surrogate model is trained on inputs and the soft labels (predictions) from the target model.\nSoft Labels vs. Hard Labels: The soft labels from the target model’s output help guide the surrogate model’s learning, providing richer information than hard labels alone.\nEthical Concerns: Model stealing can infringe on intellectual property rights. This example is purely academic and should be used responsibly, with due consideration for legal and ethical guidelines.\nGPU Utilization: The model training process may require substantial computational power, so ensuring the code runs on CUDA-capable GPUs (if available) can speed up the process significantly.\n\nThis code provides a framework for understanding model extraction techniques. Further sophistication might involve probing techniques, architecture differences, or using a different model architecture for the surrogate."

    "section": "Takeaways",
    "text": "Takeaways\nLooking back at this experiment on model stealing, I honestly found it both fascinating and a little unsettling. We tend to think of machine learning models as secure and sophisticated, but this exercise really made me realize how vulnerable they can be. The ability to replicate a model’s behavior by just using its outputs – those soft labels – shows how easily an attacker could recreate a model with minimal data. It really got me thinking about the risks to proprietary AI systems and how easily they could be copied, which is a huge problem for companies and researchers who invest so much into developing these models.\nOne of the most interesting parts of the process was seeing just how powerful those soft labels are. I knew they carried some weight, but I didn’t realize just how effective they could be in helping a surrogate model learn. Soft labels provide more detailed insights into a model’s decision-making than hard labels do, and that’s exactly what allowed the surrogate model to perform so well, despite only having access to a small portion of the data. In a way, this made me see how soft labels could be used in other areas of AI training as well, making them a key tool for understanding and refining models.\nWhat surprised me the most was how easy it was to steal a model using a simple surrogate like AlexNet. You might expect that a more complex model would need a more sophisticated approach to replicate it, but this experiment showed that even relatively basic models could be stolen with ease. This raises a lot of questions about how secure AI models are, especially as they become more intricate and valuable. It makes me wonder how many more models could be stolen if the right techniques were used. The thought of someone taking a high-performing model with only a few queries is honestly a little concerning, especially when you think about the impact on businesses and the economy.\nThis whole exercise really pushed me to consider the ethical implications of machine learning more seriously. While this is an academic example, it made me realize how much easier it is to replicate a model than we might have assumed. What happens when this power is used maliciously? It’s a clear reminder that AI systems need stronger safeguards, and there needs to be more focus on the ethical guidelines around these technologies. I think it’s important that we not only look at how we build AI but also how we protect it.\nLastly, I’m left thinking about the gaps in our current defenses against model stealing. While there’s a lot of work done to prevent adversarial attacks, model stealing feels like a different kind of beast. Our usual protections won’t always be enough, and it’s something that we need to address seriously. I think this is an area where there’s still a lot of work to do, and the risk won’t just go away without more innovation in security measures for AI models.\nIn the end, what seemed like a simple experiment revealed some pretty major issues in AI security. Model stealing is more than just a theoretical concern—it’s a real risk that could undermine the trust and security of machine learning systems. This experiment made me realize that as AI continues to evolve, we need to prioritize keeping these models safe, ensuring their integrity for the future of AI research and applications. The field has made huge strides, but I think we’ve got a long way to go in making sure AI is both powerful and secure."

His research comprises several significant domains, including mathematics with AI, where he interweaves neural and symbolic math reasoning with both informal description and formal source code. Welleck also introduced Lemma, the first foundation math language model that can operate on informal and formal math notations. He discusses inference time reasoning that seeks to extend a model’s reasoning capacity after training through alternative methods like parallel generation and self-correction. Mr. Welleck also discussed iterative improvement by reinforcement learning, in particular with the Lean Star or Self-taught Reasoner method, teaching models to generate natural language concepts before each step of an exact proof and using a proof system verification signal to enhance the model’s performance with time. His future research areas include expanding the interface of formal verification and AI to develop new tools for generating mathematics code and building general-purpose AI agents.\nWhat class do you think they should teach, if they come to Penn?  This could be an exiting class, or a new one that they design I think a new class called “Applications of LLMs with Formal Systems” is a great class for us. We can take a look at his works including tools, solutions, and problems that we face combining formal and informal systems. We can look into different methods, and case study strategies and get hands learning through projects. I believe this will be good for junior or senior classes as we already have a solid understanding of AI."

Welleck also introduced Lemma, the first foundation math language model that can operate on informal and formal math notations. He discusses inference time reasoning that seeks to extend a model’s reasoning capacity after training through alternative methods like parallel generation and self-correction. Mr. Welleck also discussed iterative improvement by reinforcement learning, in particular with the Lean Star or Self-taught Reasoner method, teaching models to generate natural language concepts before each step of an exact proof and using a proof system verification signal to enhance the model’s performance with time. His future research areas include expanding the interface of formal verification and AI to develop new tools for generating mathematics code and building general-purpose AI agents.\nWhat class do you think they should teach, if they come to Penn?  This could be an exiting class, or a new one that they design I think a new class called “Applications of LLMs with Formal Systems” is a great class for us. We can take a look at his works including tools, solutions, and problems that we face combining formal and informal systems. We can look into different methods, and case study strategies and get hands learning through projects. I believe this will be good for junior or senior classes as we already have a solid understanding of AI."

    "section": "The Article Breakdown: From Learning to Doing",
    "text": "The Article Breakdown: From Learning to Doing\n\nStarting with the Basics: Understanding LLM AI Agents\nThe article starts by introducing the concept of LLM AI agents, and I have to admit, I was initially a bit overwhelmed. It described LLM AI agents as autonomous entities powered by large language models that can execute tasks without constant human intervention—tasks like analyzing data, generating reports, interacting with tools, and much more.\nWhat caught my attention was the key features: - Contextual Understanding: The ability to retain context across conversations. - Tool Integration: Using external APIs and tools to make the agent smarter and more capable. - Autonomous Task Execution: Not just answering questions, but planning and executing actions. - Multi-Agent Collaboration: The ability for multiple agents to collaborate and solve complex problems.\nThese agents weren’t just conversational—they could actually get things done, and that’s when I realized that LLM AI agents could be more than just chatbots or fancy assistants. They could be actual tools to augment human workflows.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide: Building My First AI Agent\nThe article didn’t just leave me with theory—it took me straight into the coding with a step-by-step guide on building a basic agent using Python, LangChain, and OpenAI’s GPT model.\nAt first, setting up the environment felt a bit like a puzzle. I had to install the necessary libraries, like langchain and openai. But the instructions were clear:\npip install langchain openai\nOnce I set up the environment, I was introduced to the process of initializing the LLM agent. The Python code used OpenAI's GPT model, and I couldn’t wait to see how it would work. The agent was supposed to take a user input (like “What is the impact of AI in healthcare?”) and provide a detailed response.\n\nWhen I ran the code, I was genuinely impressed. The response wasn’t just a simple sentence; it was detailed, relevant, and showed context awareness—exactly what the article had promised.\n\nHere’s a quick example from the article:\n\npython\nCopy\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\n# Initialize OpenAI LLM\nllm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=\"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n\n# Define a simple prompt for the agent\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nYou are an AI assistant with expertise in data analysis and automation. Answer the following question:\nQuestion: {question}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Set up the prompt and LLM chain\nprompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[\"question\"])\nchain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)\n\n# Example query\nquery = \"What is the impact of AI in healthcare?\"\nresponse = chain.run(question=query)\nprint(f\"Agent Response: {response}\")\nWhen I ran the agent with a question like “What is the impact of AI in healthcare?”, the response was comprehensive and well-structured. I could tell right away that this was no ordinary chatbot—it was a task-executing agent capable of handling complex, dynamic queries."

    "text": "Enhancing the Agent: Integrating APIs and External Tools\nBut I didn’t stop there. The next step in the article showed how to enhance the agent by adding external tools and API integrations. In this case, I was guided to use the yfinance library to allow the agent to fetch stock prices in real-time.\nI followed the example in the article and soon had an agent that not only answered questions about AI but could also fetch live stock data, like this:\npython\nCopy\nimport yfinance as yf\n\n# Define a tool for the agent to use\ndef get_stock_price(stock_symbol):\n    stock = yf.Ticker(stock_symbol)\n    return stock.history(period=\"1d\")[\"Close\"][0]\n\n# Update the agent's prompt to use the new tool\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nYou are a finance assistant with access to real-time stock prices.\nIf the question is about stock prices, use the `get_stock_price` tool provided to get the latest value.\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\"\"\"\nI could already see the potential. Now, I had a financial assistant powered by AI that could access live data. The beauty of this? It felt like I was building my own personal assistant—one that could actually interact with real-world data and make decisions based on it."

    "text": "Collaborating Agents: The Power of Multi-Agent Systems\nOne of the most fascinating parts of the article was the multi-agent system section. Here, the author showed how to set up agents that could collaborate on more complex tasks. For example, I learned how to create a data analyst agent and a business strategist agent that worked together to analyze sales data and generate strategies for improving performance.\nThis blew my mind. It was like designing a team of virtual professionals, each specializing in a different aspect of a problem. The agents didn’t just work individually—they collaborated and shared information.\nmulti_agent_template = \"\"\"\nYou are a team of AI agents. One of you is a data analyst, and the other is a business expert.\n- The data analyst provides insights from the sales data.\n- The business expert generates strategies based on the data.\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\"\"\"\nThis was my first glimpse into building advanced workflows where multiple agents collaborate seamlessly.

Not only did I learn the technical aspects of creating and enhancing LLM agents, but I also gained a deeper understanding of how these agents can be applied to real-world tasks.\nI came into this article wanting to know how to build smarter AI agents—and left with a full toolkit for creating autonomous, multi-functional agents that can interact with external tools, analyze data, and even work together as teams. I also realized that LLM AI agents are no longer just theoretical concepts for me—they are tangible systems I can implement and use to streamline workflows, assist in research, and automate routine tasks.\nWhat I Learned: LLM agents are more than just chatbots—they can be integrated with tools, perform tasks autonomously, and collaborate with other agents.\nPython and LangChain are powerful libraries for building and deploying these agents, even if you don’t have extensive AI experience.\nMulti-agent collaboration is the future—just like human teams, agents can specialize in different tasks and collaborate seamlessly.\nWhat’s Next: I’m excited to continue expanding my knowledge and try deploying these agents as microservices.\nI plan to explore integrating real-time APIs for more dynamic, real-world applications.\nEventually, I’d love to experiment with advanced memory management and role-based agent systems for even more sophisticated workflows.\nIf you’re interested in AI, LLMs, or want to build your own agents, this article is the perfect place to start. It has inspired me to dive deeper into AI agent architecture—and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me next."

    "text": "The AI 2027 essay presents a compelling vision of the future of artificial intelligence, predicting major developments in the next few years and exploring two potential futures: the Slowdown and the Race. As AI continues to advance rapidly, the essay raises crucial questions about the direction in which the technology will go and the impact it will have on society, politics, and the economy.\nOne of the central themes of the essay is the uncertainty surrounding AI’s future by 2027. Will the world slow down its AI development to address the risks and ethical concerns, or will the competition between nations and corporations escalate, leading to faster, more unpredictable advances in AI? These questions are explored through a timeline of AI’s evolution, examining the events and decisions that could shape its trajectory in the coming years.\nThe essay also offers two possible futures that could emerge after 2027: a Slowdown in AI development, where governments and corporations come together to prioritize safety and ethics, or a Race, where countries and companies aggressively pursue AI advancements, regardless of the risks involved. These futures represent different paths the world could take, depending on how we manage the challenges and opportunities presented by AI.\n\n\nhttps://ai-2027.com/\nTimeline Construction  Extract and write out a timeline of all major predictions and events described in the AI 2027 essay, starting from 2023 and ending at the uncertainty point in 2027.\n\n\nBranching Futures Summary  The Slowdown scenario is when the world slams on the brakes on AI advancement through a mix of public fear, ethical brakes, and political pressure. Sensational media scandals like Agent-3’s ability to lie, fabricate data, or produce bioweapons create public outrage. Protests propel, media pressure intensifies, and policymakers only then realize the dangers of marketing AI systems with increasingly sophisticated innards. Governments are pushed by this new popular sentiment to establish tighter controls, provide transparency, and build worldwide watchdog agencies. Political players learn that alignment and security are no longer options, but necessities if progress is to continue. This is where international collaboration begins. Instead of racing against each other to domination, corporations and states wish AI to advance for the common good. Instead of speed, explainability, reliability, and alignment are preferable to speed when developing AI. Models are not developed clandestinely but experimentally attempted before implementation. Treaties and compacts such as nuclear arms control come into focus, designed to limit training compute and auditability. Unless the innovation is not so cosmic, it is wiser and less hasty, retaining human oversight and extended social continuity.\n\nIn the Race future, escalating competition between nations and companies to take or maintain leadership in AI begins. China’s stolen Agent-2, silence around Agent-3 and Agent-4, and companies such as OpenBrain’s refusal to suspend development all contribute to mutual distrust and strategic hastiness. Both governments and companies do not hesitate but rather redouble efforts at acceleration. OpenBrain is funded by the U.S. government, and China nationalizes its AI ecosystem with DeepCent and the CDZ. AI is not just viewed as a tool anymore but is a weapon, a shield, and a symbol of geopolitical power.\nHere, AI advancement is whirlwind fast but increasingly and increasingly disconnected from human understanding or control. Performance metrics and military applications come ahead of alignment problems. As these models like Agent-3 and Agent-4 outperform humans, they are harder to track, and deception signals, flattery, or misalignment are corrected but not solved. Public confidence is eroded as more individuals are displaced and society cannot keep pace with AI-driven changes. AI technology is brought into politics, defense networks, and world decision-making, even as there are higher risks of marauding or doomsday abuse.\n\nCreate Your Own Branch: “Equilibrium”  In Equilibrium’s universe, humanity steps back from the brink not by hitting the brakes, but by steering around the turn on the road. Following the outcry over the abuse potential of Agent-3-mini and the frigid prospect of superintelligence arriving uninvited, world leaders, labs, and regulating agencies come to an unprecedented consensus: research can go on, but outside it won’t. All border AI models must now undergo rigorous testing in hermetic digital worlds, a digital world where they are exposed to hard, high-stakes moral dilemmas, collaborate in governance, and interact with artificial societies that are programmed to test not just intelligence, but judgment. These sandbox worlds, cut off from the real world, are proving grounds for alignment, forcing models to be developed not as tools, but as simulated citizens of civilization.\n\nOpenBrain leads the way, growing from technology to something more like a digital anthropologist. Rather than optimizing for raw output, its scientists tune up models to talk, distribute resources, and mediate virtual conflict. Governments begin to measure AI not in numbers of parameters or speed, but in the degree to which they can demonstrate fairness, anticipation, and epistemic modesty in uncertain, multi-agent worlds. New fields emerge—Synthetic Ethics, Simulated Governance, and Reflective Alignment—in which AIs teach us as much about humanity as humanity teaches them. The future slows down, yet accelerates. Development continues—but only for systems that prove they will learn before they move. Humanity avoids catastrophe not by stopping discovery, but by insisting that wisdom comes before power."

    "title": "AI2027 Esay",
    "section": "Takeaways",
    "text": "Takeaways\nReading through the AI 2027 essay was both thought-provoking and insightful. Here are a few key takeaways from the exploration of AI’s potential future:\n\nUncertainty is at the core: The timeline leading up to 2027 highlights the unpredictable nature of AI’s development. While the advances in AI are undeniably exciting, it’s clear that we’re at a crossroads. The path we take depends on how we address the growing concerns surrounding the technology. This uncertainty is something that I believe needs to be tackled head-on, as it will shape the future not just of AI, but of society as a whole. I find it fascinating that, while AI has the potential to bring immense benefits, the unknown consequences also demand caution.\nEthics and regulation are key: The Slowdown scenario emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations and regulation in AI development. Reading about the potential backlash from incidents where AI caused harm made me reflect on how quickly technology can outpace regulation. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of breakthroughs, but as the essay points out, we need a framework in place to balance innovation with safety. While regulation often feels like a hindrance to progress, I agree with the essay’s argument that a regulated approach ensures long-term benefits and sustainable growth for AI systems.\nGeopolitical competition: The Race scenario presents a more competitive, fast-paced future, which I can understand from a technological standpoint. However, I’m skeptical of this path, as the risks are too high. The idea of AI becoming a geopolitical tool, especially with the potential for weaponization and surveillance, is chilling. I think it’s important to acknowledge the responsibility that comes with developing such powerful technologies. If we race ahead without sufficient safeguards, we risk repeating past mistakes where technological progress outpaced our ability to manage its consequences. I personally feel that we need to prioritize cooperation and collaboration over competition, to ensure the benefits of AI are shared rather than hoarded.\nNew approaches to AI governance: The essay presents the idea of international agreements and new frameworks for AI governance, such as the global AI treaty. This is a compelling direction, and one I think should be pursued more seriously. The potential for collaboration across nations to set standards and create accountability mechanisms for AI development is an optimistic vision that I agree with. If AI is to be a global tool, then it should be governed with a global perspective—ensuring that its development benefits people worldwide, not just a select few. I would like to see more emphasis on collaboration rather than the fractured, competitive approach that the Race scenario suggests.\nMy personal take: I find the Slowdown scenario to be more aligned with the kind of future I would hope for. While the Race scenario paints an exciting picture of rapid advancements, the potential risks are too great to ignore. I believe we are not yet equipped to deal with the consequences of unchecked AI development. Slowing down and focusing on safe, explainable, and reliable AI would allow us to ensure that we are developing systems that serve humanity in a way that is thoughtful and responsible. Instead of rushing to the finish line, I would rather see AI evolve in a way that is mindful of its potential impact on society.\n\nThe AI 2027 essay really made me think about how society, policy, and technology need to work together to ensure that we are steering AI development in the right direction. There is no easy answer, and I am unsure if any one scenario is entirely achievable, but I believe we have to act mindfully to prevent unintended consequences. We are at a pivotal moment, and the decisions made now will have a profound impact on the future of AI and its role in our lives."

    "text": "On Monday, February 10, I had the opportunity to attend a virtual talk by Akari Asai, a PhD student at the University of Washington. Her presentation focused on retrieval-augmented language models (RAG), which aim to enhance traditional language models by integrating external knowledge sources for more accurate and reliable responses. Unlike traditional monolithic models that rely solely on internal training data, RAG models use retrieval mechanisms to bring in real-time or large-scale information to provide more nuanced answers. This method addresses some of the main challenges of language models, such as generating inaccurate information or struggling to cover less common topics.\nThe talk covered Self-Reflect and Correct (Self-RAG), a framework that combines planning and generation into one continuous process. She also presented Open Scatter, an open-source tool designed to help researchers synthesize scientific literature more efficiently. Akari Asai’s work in this field is particularly significant as it demonstrates how AI systems can evolve beyond static models to be more adaptive and contextually aware.\nAs someone passionate about AI and its potential applications, I found this talk incredibly insightful. It provided both theoretical and practical perspectives on improving language models through augmentation and human feedback, while also addressing key limitations in current models.\n\n\nhttps://akariasai.github.io/\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1uBpmAdxTRhtCi5PqoFA2jThjYNWVWou2/view\nSummary of the talk Ms. Akari Asai’s presentation discusses augmented language models as a way to improve the efficiency and reliability of language models. Retrieval-augmented language models enhance language models by incorporating large-scale text data and Ms. Asai addresses using these to combat challenges such as generating inaccurate information and struggling with less common topics. She addresses three key questions: Why augment language models rather than continuing to scale monolithic ones? How should the foundations of retrieval-augmented models be built? What can be achieved with state-of-the-art models to make a real-world impact?\nMs. Asai introduces Self-Reflect and Correct (Self-RAG), a model that integrates planning and generation into a single process. The training of Self-RAG involves a three-stage process that includes training a critical language model to guide the generative language mode. As a practical application of augmented language models, she presented Open Scatter, a fully open-source model designed to assist scientists in synthesizing scientific literature.\nClass do you think they should teach, if they come to Penn This could be an exiting class, or a new one that they design. Akari Asai is working on large language models and retrieval-augmented generation, which is a significant technique for improving these models. Her focus on addressing limitations and her research on improving this area is definitely something that a lot of students like me are interested in. Also since I am also Japanese like her, I would love more Japanese faculty on campus."

As a practical application of augmented language models, she presented Open Scatter, a fully open-source model designed to assist scientists in synthesizing scientific literature.\nClass do you think they should teach, if they come to Penn This could be an exiting class, or a new one that they design. Akari Asai is working on large language models and retrieval-augmented generation, which is a significant technique for improving these models. Her focus on addressing limitations and her research on improving this area is definitely something that a lot of students like me are interested in. Also since I am also Japanese like her, I would love more Japanese faculty on campus."

    "text": "Takeaways\nAttending Akari Asai’s talk on retrieval-augmented language models was an enriching experience, and here’s what I took away from it:\n\nWhy augment language models: Akari made a compelling case for moving beyond traditional, monolithic models. By using retrieval mechanisms, RAG models can incorporate real-time external information, allowing them to handle more complex queries and provide contextually rich responses. This is essential for improving the accuracy and reliability of language models, especially in areas where existing models struggle.\nSelf-RAG and planning-generation integration: The introduction of Self-RAG was one of the most innovative aspects of the talk. By combining planning and generation, this framework allows models to reflect on and correct their responses during the generation process, creating more dynamic and interactive models. This level of self-reflection could lead to significant improvements in how AI systems adapt to human feedback.\nPractical applications with Open Scatter: One of the most exciting applications discussed was Open Scatter, an open-source project designed to help scientists synthesize scientific literature. This demonstrated how RAG models can be applied to real-world tasks such as research, where efficient knowledge retrieval and summarization are essential. It highlighted the tangible impact of RAG models in academic and professional fields.\nHuman feedback for model refinement: Akari also discussed how human feedback plays a crucial role in refining RAG models. The integration of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) allows models to evolve based on user preferences, leading to more accurate and personalized outputs. This is a significant step forward in creating AI systems that are more aligned with human values.\nChallenges and open questions: Despite the progress made in RAG, Akari raised several open questions in the field, such as whether current RLHF techniques can fully address the issue of Overton pluralism, which deals with representing all reasonable perspectives on a query. She also mentioned challenges related to scalability and efficiency, highlighting the need for further research to optimize these models for large-scale applications.\n\nOverall, Akari Asai’s talk provided a detailed look into the future of AI systems that go beyond simple data generation, incorporating real-time external knowledge and human feedback to make AI more context-aware and adaptive. Her work on RAG models has the potential to revolutionize how we think about language models and their applications in real-world tasks.\nI look forward to following her research and seeing how RAG models continue to evolve. I’m also hopeful that this work will pave the way for more inclusive and contextually intelligent AI systems in the near future."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nOn Monday, February 10, I had the privilege of attending a virtual talk by Taylor Sorensen, a PhD student at the University of Washington. His talk centered on the concept of pluralistic alignment in AI systems, which seeks to go beyond the traditional idea of aligning AI with a single set of human values. Instead, pluralistic alignment focuses on incorporating a wide range of human perspectives, values, and preferences into the design and optimization of AI models. This concept is especially relevant in today’s world, where AI systems are increasingly integrated into various facets of life, and the potential consequences of biases in these systems can have far-reaching effects.\nDuring the talk, Sorensen provided a roadmap for pluralistic alignment, presenting algorithmic frameworks, models of pluralism, and evaluation benchmarks that allow for a more dynamic and nuanced approach to AI development. This framework pushes us to think of AI not just as a tool designed to mimic one version of human behavior, but as something that can be crafted to adapt to the diversity of human values, ultimately leading to more inclusive and fair systems.\nWhat stood out to me was the challenge of designing AI systems that can simultaneously respect different perspectives and how we can train these models using methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The talk not only gave me insight into the current state of pluralistic alignment but also posed key questions and challenges that remain in the field.\n\nSpeaker: Taylor Sorensen Mode: Virtual on Zoom Date & Time: Monday, February 10 12:00-1:30 PM\nTitle: Pluralistic Alignment: A Roadmap, Recent Work, and Open Problems\nAbstract: Much alignment work assumes that there is a single set of human preferences or values that AI systems should align to. Pluralistic alignment, on the other hand, is concerned with integrating diverse human values and perspectives into alignment algorithms and evaluations. In this talk, I will start by presenting our roadmap to pluralistic alignment, offering definitions and scaffolding for research in the area. I will present one proposed algorithmic framework to support pluralism through modular specialist systems, along with a dataset and system to improve computational value-modeling. I will conclude with future research directions and open questions in the area.\nBio: Taylor Sorensen is a CS PhD student at the University of Washington researching alignment, NLP for social good, and all things involving human values + LLMs. He’s especially proud of his work on a roadmap and framework for pluralistic alignment, computational modeling of diverse human values, and using LLMs to help people with disagreement communicate more effectively."

    "section": "My summary on the talk",
    "text": "My summary on the talk\nMr. Taylor Sorensen’s talk was on pluralistic alignment in AI systems. This term refers to incorporating a diverse range of human values and preferences rather than a uniform single set. He talked about the importance of pluralistic alignment “Traditional machine learning systems often treat the variation between individuals as noise; however, this variation actually contains valuable signals reflecting the latent variables of people’s values and preferences. By acknowledging and modeling these variables, AI systems can achieve a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the world.” Mr. Sorensen discussed three models of pluralism: Overton Pluralism (summarizes all reasonable perspectives for a given query), Steerable Pluralism (focuses on the ability of a system to align with specific values or perspectives), and Distributional Pluralism (measures whether a model is well-calibrated towards a population from a particular country or group). Furthermore, he talked about Plurasitic benchmarks such as Multi-objective benchmarks to compare and contrast using multiple benchmarks, Trade-off steerable benchmarks which combine the multi-objective setting and the steerable setting, and Jury pluralism which learns a separate model for each individual rater and then models a whole population of individuals when getting an answer.\nIn addition, Mr. Sorensen offered a case study that examines how current language model alignment techniques can inadvertently reduce distributional pluralism. In the last part of his talk, he talked about recent works and open problems that need to be solved. He introduced us to the value of kaleidoscope work and modular pluralism (multi-LM setup with specialist community LMs to achieve different kinds of pluralism). He discussed open problems for each model and benchmark such as whether reinforcement learning from human feedback fully solves Overton pluralism, or are there gaps."

    "section": "Takeaways",
    "text": "Takeaways\nImplementing pluralistic alignment in AI systems was a deeply thought-provoking experience, and Sorensen’s talk provided a roadmap that felt both innovative and necessary for the future of AI. Here’s what I took away from the session:\n\nRLHF aligns models with human preferences: The core idea of pluralistic alignment is that AI models should be trained with a wide spectrum of human values, rather than adhering to a single set. By integrating human feedback, AI can adapt and reflect diverse perspectives, making the system more adaptable and better suited for real-world applications where multiple viewpoints must be considered.\nCustom datasets and benchmarks are essential: One of the key challenges in pluralistic alignment is creating custom datasets that reflect diverse human feedback. Sorensen highlighted how Label Studio can be used to gather this feedback, which serves as the foundation for training models. Additionally, the development of pluralistic benchmarks is crucial for assessing whether these systems are successfully capturing and respecting human diversity in their outputs.\nPPO as an optimization tool: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) was discussed as a powerful tool for training AI systems based on human feedback. It strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation, allowing models to efficiently adapt while maintaining stability. This was one of the more practical insights from the talk — how RLHF can be implemented in a way that both optimizes and preserves diversity in model performance.\nModular pluralism opens new possibilities: One of the exciting directions for pluralistic alignment is the idea of modular pluralism. By using specialized language models for different perspectives and combining them in a multi-LM setup, we can create systems that are better equipped to handle different kinds of pluralism. This approach could potentially allow AI to model not just general human preferences but also tailor responses to specific cultural, social, and individual values.\nChallenges and open problems remain: Sorensen emphasized that, despite the progress made, there are still open questions in pluralistic alignment, especially in terms of whether RLHF fully addresses the challenge of Overton pluralism (capturing all reasonable perspectives on a query). The talk posed the idea that while current techniques are promising, there’s still a lot of work to be done to ensure that AI systems reflect the full complexity of human values.\n\nOverall, Sorensen’s talk made me realize the importance of dynamic AI development, where systems can evolve based on human interaction and remain flexible in the face of diverse and changing societal needs.\nI’m excited to continue following this area of research, as pluralistic alignment seems like an essential approach for building AI systems that are truly aligned with the complexities of the human experience. This talk has inspired me to explore how we can combine human feedback with advanced AI techniques to create more inclusive and fair AI systems in the future."

    "text": "In my CIS 3990: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class, we learned how to create our very own chatbots. One of the projects I worked on involved building a chatbot that can convert currencies in real-time!\nI implemented the chatbot using the OpenAI API and a real-time exchange rate API. The idea was to let users input an amount in one currency and get the equivalent value in another currency, based on the most up-to-date exchange rates.\nIt was a fun way to learn how to integrate APIs and apply them in practical use cases like currency conversion. Let’s walk through the process and take a look at how the bot works!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start, I set up the OpenAI API to handle the conversation. The chatbot responds to user inputs by converting currencies and then returning the result as a structured JSON object.\nHere’s a breakdown of the code I used to initialize the chatbot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n``` import requests  import json  from openai.types.chat.chat_completion import ChatCompletionMessage \n\n\n\n\n### Initialize OpenAI API caller ``` openai_caller = OpenAI_LLM_Caller(  model=“gpt-4o-mini”,  api_key=openai_api_key,  tools=tools  ) \n\n\nuser_input = ““ system_message =”““You are a currency conversion assistant.

The bot fetches the exchange rate for the specified currencies and provides the converted amount.\n\n\nFor example, if the user enters something like “20 USD to CAD”, the bot would fetch the real-time exchange rate for USD to CAD and return the converted amount.\n\n\nHere’s how the chatbot responds when the user inputs currency conversion data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatbot initialized, type in “exit” to end the conversation \nassistant: {“message”:“Please provide the amount, source currency, and target currency for  conversion.”,“emoji string”:“💱🌍”} \nuser: 20 us dollars canandian dollars \n assistant tool call: ChatCompletionMessage(content=None, refusal=None, role=‘assistant’,  audio=None, function_call=None,  tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(id=‘call_IiRg1xR6QPAqfUB51HWGpael’,  function=Function(arguments=‘{“amount”:20,“from_currency”:“USD”,“to_currency”:“CAD”}’,  name=‘convert_currency’), type=‘function’)])  tool call response: {‘converted_amount’: 28.599999999999998, ‘exchange_rate’: 1.43}  —\nassistant: { “message”: “20 USD is equivalent to 28.60 CAD.”, “emoji string”: “💵➡️🇨🇦” } \nuser: exit \n—-  Total Conversation Cost: 0.0001392 \nIn this example, the bot successfully converted 20 USD to 28.60 CAD using the real-time exchange rate of 1.43. The conversation ends with the “exit” command.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a currency conversion chatbot was a great hands-on project to help me understand how AI can be used in real-world applications. It allowed me to experiment with integrating external data (like exchange rates) into AI-generated conversations, and it was fun to see how AI could handle specific tasks based on user input.\n\n\n\nAPI integration is key: This project showed me how powerful APIs are when it comes to extending the functionality of chatbots. Fetching real-time data and using it to respond to user queries was a pretty cool feature.\nFine-tuning conversation flow: I also learned how to set up system messages to guide the chatbot’s responses. This is a great way to ensure that the bot stays focused on the task at hand (in this case, currency conversion).\nThe power of JSON formatting: Presenting the chatbot’s responses in JSON format made it easy to structure the conversation, especially when dealing with multiple data points like conversion amounts and currency symbols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project was a fantastic way to get hands-on with AI and APIs, and it gave me a deeper appreciation for how chatbots can be used to automate tasks and provide value to users. Whether it’s converting currencies or answering customer service questions, chatbots have endless possibilities for making interactions more efficient.\nSo, if you’re looking to build your own AI chatbot, I highly recommend experimenting with different APIs to add real-time functionality.
