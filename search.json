    "text": "First Letter of Emoji Game\n\nSince we learned about how words are tokenized in AI and assigned values, I wondered if that is the same with emojis too.\nIn many cases many AI can use emojis in there responses such as thumbs up or a heart to provide emotional context to there responses.\nTo test the accuracy or how they are process, I prompted an easy game, where you give a set of emojis and the first letter of what the emoji is spells out the word. For example 🍔🐘🦎🦎🐙 spells out hello. I tested this on both CHATGPT 4o and Claude ai 3.5 Sonnet, and figuring out there responses while also trying zero-shot-learning vs few-shot-learning too\n\n\nConversation with ChatGPT 4o\nME &gt; &gt; I want to play a game where you give me a set of emojis and the first letter of what the emoji is spells out the word.\n&gt;Ill go first.\n&gt; 🍔🐘🦎🦎🐙 spells out hello\n&gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt;Great idea! Here’s a set for you: 🐊🍎🦁🦁 🐳🦅. Can you figure out the word? &gt;\nME &gt;lallwe? &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;Almost there! The word is actually “alley.” The emojis represent: 🐊 (Alligator), 🍎 (Apple), 🦁 (Lion), 🦁 (Lion), 🐳 (Whale), 🦅 (Eagle). Try another one! &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;I want to play a game where you give me a set of emojis and the first letter of what the emoji is spells out the world. Ill go first. 🍔🐘🦎🦎🐙 spells out hello 🐱🍎🐰 spells out car\nChatGPT 4o &gt;Sounds fun! Here’s a set for you: 🐢⚡🍎🌵🦓🦓. Can you figure out the word? &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;tlaczz? &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;Close! The word is “tacoma.” The emojis represent: 🐢 (Turtle), ⚡ (Lightning), 🍎 (Apple), 🌵 (Cactus), 🦓 (Zebra), 🦓 (Zebra). Want to try another one?\nME &gt; &gt;That is incorrect\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;I apologize for the oversight. Let’s try a different set of emojis: 🐍🍎👑🌵. Can you figure out the word?\nME &gt;no fix the one &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt;I’m sorry for the mix-up earlier. Let’s go through the original emoji set again: 🐢⚡🍎🌵🦓🦓. &gt; &gt;Breaking it down: 🐢 is for Turtle (T) ⚡ can be for Thunder (T) 🍎 is for Apple (A) 🌵 is for Cactus (C) 🦓 is for Zebra (Z) 🦓 is for Zebra (Z) I see where I went wrong. The correct word cannot be formed with those emojis. Let’s try a new set: &gt; &gt;📦⚡🍎🌵🛋️. Can you figure out the word?\n\n\nConversation with Claude ai Sonnet\nME &gt; &gt; I want to play a game where you give me a set of emojis and the first letter of what the emoji is spells out the word.\n&gt;Ill go first.\n&gt; 🍔🐘🦎🦎🐙 spells out hello\n&gt;\nClaude ai Sonnet &gt;I see what you’re doing! You used: Hamburger Elephant Lizard Lizard Octopus To spell HELLO. That’s clever! Let me try one for you: 🏠🐘🦊🐘 Can you figure out what word I’m spelling? &gt;\nME &gt;hefe &gt;\nClaude ai Sonnet &gt; &gt;Yes, exactly! I used: House Elephant Fox Elephant To spell HEFE! You got it! Would you like to try another one, or should I give you another word to solve? &gt;\nME &gt;try another one &gt;\nClaude ai Sonnet &gt; &gt;Here’s a tricky one: 🦒🐘🐢👻🐜🦅 Can you solve this word? (Hint: Think of talking with someone!)\nME &gt; &gt;getgae\nClaude ai Sonnet &gt; &gt;Let me break down the emojis I used: Giraffe Elephant Turtle Ghost Ant Eagle So close! The word I was trying to spell is “GENTLE”. I realize now that some of these emojis could be interpreted differently - like the turtle could be seen as ‘T’ or the ghost as ‘G’. Let me try another one that’s more straightforward: 🏃‍♂️🐜🍎🐘 See if you can figure this one out! &gt;\nME &gt;make it a word\nClaude ai Sonnet &gt;Oh! You want me to spell out “MAKE” with emojis? Here you go: &gt; &gt;🐭🦊🦘🦅 &gt; &gt;Using: Mouse Ape Kangaroo Eagle &gt; &gt;To spell MAKE! See if you can solve another one or give me a word to turn into emojis! &gt;"

I am still learning and making mistakes.\nIt seems I am having trouble accurately counting the cookies in the image.\nCould you please tell me what answer you are getting? This will help me learn and improve.\nI am committed to getting better at this!\n\nME\n\n30\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro\n\nAh, I see where I went wrong!\nI was counting the numbers as individual cookies, instead of realizing they represent the quantity in each column.\nSo, it’s:\n2 columns of cookies on the left 3 columns of cookies in the middle 5 columns of cookies on the right That makes a total of 30 cookies!\nThank you for helping me understand. I appreciate your patience as I learn and improve. I am starting to see how tricky image interpretation can be!"
