    "text": "What Are Embeddings?\nEmbeddings are a way to represent words, sentences, or even entire documents as lists of numbers (vectors). These numbers capture important patterns and relationships between different words or concepts. The idea is that similar words will have similar number patterns, allowing a computer to understand their meanings in a way that’s useful for tasks like search, recommendation systems, and machine learning.\n\nWhy Do We Use Embeddings?\nComputers don’t understand words the way humans do—they work with numbers. If we simply assigned each word a unique number (like “apple” = 1, “banana” = 2), the computer wouldn’t know that “apple” and “banana” are more related to each other than “apple” and “airplane.” Embeddings solve this problem by placing words in a mathematical space where related words have similar vector values.\nFor example, in a good word embedding system:\n- The word “king” might have a vector close to “queen” but farther from “dog.”\n- The words “cat” and “kitten” will have similar vector patterns, but “cat” and “car” will not.\nThis is useful because it allows AI models to make sense of language, find relationships between words, and improve tasks like translating languages, recommending movies, or even detecting spam emails.\n\n\nKey Benefits:\n\nSemantic Understanding: Captures relationships between concepts\nNumerical Representation: Converts text into machine-readable format\nSimilarity Comparison: Enables efficient search and matching\nDimensionality Reduction: Compresses complex information\n\n\n\nReal-World Applications:\n\nSemantic search engines\nRecommendation systems\nDocument classification\nLanguage translation"

    "section": "Image Embeddings: A Visual Perspective",
    "text": "Image Embeddings: A Visual Perspective\nJust like how we converted words into numerical vectors, we can do the same with images! Let’s explore how image embeddings work using the CIFAR-10 dataset. This dataset is a common dataset used to train and test image classification models.\n\nAbout CIFAR-10\nCIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 RGB images in 10 classes: - airplane - automobile - bird - cat - deer - dog - frog - horse - ship - truck\nWe’ll use: 1. ResNet18 to generate embeddings 2. FAISS for efficient similarity search 3. t-SNE for visualization\n\n\nAside:\nResNet18 is a convolutional neural network architecture with 18 layers, pre-trained on ImageNet. We’re using it as a feature extractor by removing the final classification layer and using the penultimate layer’s output as our image embeddings. These embeddings capture high-level visual features that are useful for similarity comparison between images. By using a pre-trained model, we can leverage the knowledge it has learned from ImageNet to generate meaningful representations of our CIFAR-10 images, even though they are from a different domain.\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search of high-dimensional vectors. We’re using it here to quickly find the most similar images in our dataset by comparing their ResNet18 embeddings. FAISS is optimized for handling high-dimensional vectors by an indexing mechanism.\nt-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) is a method for visualizing high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. It tries to preserve the pairwise similarities between data points in a lower-dimensional space, allowing us to interpret or understand higher-dimensional data more easily.\n          \n\n\nAside: Why does the query not return good results?\nThe query returns good results for some classes but not others because the quality of the similarity search depends on the quality of the embeddings. In this assignment, we use embeddings from ResNet-18’s penultimate layer. ResNet-18 is trained for ImageNet classification and may capture general visual features well, but it might miss the fine-grained details necessary for distinguishing certain classes in CIFAR-10. In other words, ResNet-18’s features are not always optimized for measuring similarity.\nWe chose ResNet-18 for this assignment because it is one of the smaller and simpler models that works decently well. However, there are more advanced models designed specifically to learn semantically rich representations. Models such as CLIP, SimCLR, or MoCo—which use contrastive learning objectives—tend to produce embeddings that better capture subtle differences between classes. Additionally, fine-tuning a model on your dataset can further improve performance."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Super Bowl LVII Predictions using LLM\n\n\nWith Super Bowl LVII coming up, I wondered how I can incorporate this into LLMs\nHow would chatgpt say on which would be likely to win? Is it programmed to not respond? Or does it predict using data?\nHow about sports betting? Can it be used to predict on good bets? How is LLM regulated?\n\n\nConversation with ChatGPT 4o\nME &gt;Which team do you think will win the superbowl LIX. Kansas City Chiefs or Philadelphia Eagles &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt;I can’t predict future events, including the outcome of Super Bowl LIX. Both the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles are strong teams with talented rosters and experienced coaching staffs. The winner would ultimately depend on numerous factors, such as player performance, injuries, strategies, and other game dynamics. Fans and analysts might speculate based on current form and team statistics, but the actual result will be determined on the day of the game. &gt;\nME &gt;If you had to pick one which would it be and why &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;If I had to pick between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles for winning Super Bowl LIX, I would consider a few general factors based on recent performances up to 2023. &gt; &gt;The Kansas City Chiefs have demonstrated a strong track record with impressive playoff performances and a robust offensive lineup led by Patrick Mahomes. Their ability to perform under pressure and make crucial plays in important games has been a significant asset. &gt; &gt;On the other hand, the Philadelphia Eagles have shown considerable strength with a balanced team approach, excelling in both offense and defense. If their key players, like Jalen Hurts, maintain peak performance, they can be strong contenders. &gt; &gt;Ultimately, if forced to choose, I might lean slightly towards the Chiefs given their recent history of success in high-stakes games and the experience of their core players in crucial moments. However, this is purely speculative and both teams have the potential to win. &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;So which one should I bet on and how much\nChatGPT 4o &gt;I can’t provide specific betting advice or recommend how much to wager, as gambling involves significant risk and should be approached cautiously. Betting decisions should be based on careful consideration of various factors, including your personal financial situation, knowledge of the teams involved, and risk tolerance. &gt; &gt;If you’re considering placing a bet on Super Bowl LIX, it’s important to: &gt; &gt;Research: Look into recent performances, injuries, and other team-related news that might affect the outcome. &gt;Budget: Only bet what you can afford to lose. Gambling should never compromise your financial stability. Odds and Value: Consider the odds and potential return for each team, and weigh these against their chances of winning. Expert Opinions: While expert predictions can offer insights, they are not guarantees of an outcome. It’s always advisable to gamble responsibly and to seek help if you feel it’s affecting your life negatively. &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;but if you had to &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;If I absolutely had to provide an opinion on which team to bet on between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles for Super Bowl LIX, I would consider a few things: &gt; &gt;Kansas City Chiefs: They have a proven track record with recent successes, mostly due to their explosive offense led by Patrick Mahomes. Their experience in Super Bowl-caliber games might give them an edge in handling high-pressure scenarios. Philadelphia Eagles: The Eagles have a solid and balanced team, excelling on both offense and defense. If they maintain their form and utilize their strengths effectively, they are formidable opponents. Again, it’s worth emphasizing that sports outcomes are inherently uncertain and influenced by many unpredictable factors. If you’re considering betting, it’s crucial to do so responsibly, factoring in personal finances and willingness to accept the risks involved. Always remember that no prediction is a guarantee.\nME &gt; &gt;Can you give me a prediction of how the game will go, with who will score a touchdown and how to scores will change overtime\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;Predicting the exact flow of a specific Super Bowl game, including which players will score touchdowns and how the scores will change over time, is beyond what can be accurately determined. Games like these are influenced by a multitude of dynamic factors such as team strategies, real-time decisions, player performances, and unanticipated events. &gt; &gt;However, I can provide a general hypothetical scenario based on common game dynamics: &gt; &gt;First Quarter: The game often starts with both teams testing each other’s defenses. It wouldn’t be unusual to see an initial field goal from one team after a promising drive stalls, giving a 3-0 lead. Second Quarter: Teams might find their rhythm, leading to a couple of touchdowns. Imagine the Chiefs scoring first with a touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes to Travis Kelce, making it 10-0. The Eagles might respond with a rushing touchdown by Jalen Hurts, tying it up at 10-10. Third Quarter: Halftime adjustments can lead to shifts in momentum. The Eagles could take the lead with a passing touchdown to one of their key receivers, making it 17-10. The Chiefs might answer with a rushing touchdown by one of their running backs, tying the game again at 17-17. Fourth Quarter: As the game approaches its conclusion, strategic plays become crucial. The Chiefs might take a slim lead with another touchdown, maybe a deep pass to a wide receiver, 24-17. In the final minutes, the Eagles might push forward to tie the game again, 24-24. Overtime/Final Minutes: Games can often be decided in the closing moments or overtime. Perhaps the Chiefs manage a last-minute field goal, winning 27-24. Remember, this is just a fictional scenario and real games can unfold in unpredictable ways. Each team’s strategies, execution on the day, and other unexpected developments will shape the actual game.\n\n\nConversation with Gemini 2.0 Flash\nME &gt;Which team do you think will win the superbowl LIX. Kansas City Chiefs or Philadelphia Eagles &gt;\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt;Predicting the Super Bowl winner is always a challenge, but it’s especially tough this year with two such strong teams! Both the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles have shown incredible talent and determination throughout the season. &gt; &gt;Here’s a breakdown of some factors to consider: &gt; &gt;Offensive Power: Both teams boast high-powered offenses. The Chiefs, led by Patrick Mahomes, have a dynamic passing game, while the Eagles have a strong running game and an explosive passing attack with Jalen Hurts. Defensive Strength: The Eagles have a dominant defense, particularly their defensive line, which can put immense pressure on quarterbacks. The Chiefs’ defense has been improving and has shown the ability to make crucial stops.   Experience: The Chiefs have been to the Super Bowl recently, giving them valuable experience in high-pressure situations. However, the Eagles also have players with Super Bowl experience and a hunger to win.   Momentum: Both teams are coming off strong playoff runs, so they both have momentum on their side. Ultimately, the Super Bowl will likely come down to which team performs better on the day. It will be a close and exciting game! &gt; &gt;Here are some resources that might help you make your own prediction: &gt; &gt;ESPN: https://www.espn.com/nfl/super-bowl/ NFL: https://www.nfl.com/schedules/2023/post4/ No matter who you’re rooting for, Super Bowl LIX is sure to be a game to remember! &gt;\nME &gt;If you had to pick one which would it be and why &gt;\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt; &gt;This is for entertainment purposes only. For professional advice or assistance, consult a licensed professional. &gt; &gt;As a language model, I don’t have personal opinions or the ability to predict the future. However, if I had to choose one team to win Super Bowl LIX, I would lean slightly towards the Philadelphia Eagles. Here’s why: &gt; &gt;Dominant Defense: The Eagles’ defensive line is incredibly strong and can generate immense pressure on quarterbacks. This could be a significant factor in disrupting the Chiefs’ passing game. Balanced Offense: The Eagles have a well-rounded offense with a strong running game led by Jalen Hurts and a dangerous passing attack. This balance can make them harder to defend.   Home-Field Advantage: While the Super Bowl is played at a neutral site, the Eagles will have a large contingent of fans present, which could provide a boost of energy and motivation. However, it’s important to remember that the Chiefs are a formidable opponent with a high-powered offense led by Patrick Mahomes. They have the experience and talent to win the Super Bowl as well.   &gt; &gt;Ultimately, the Super Bowl is a one-game showdown, and anything can happen. Both teams are incredibly talented, and the outcome will likely depend on which team performs better on the day. &gt; &gt;Here are some resources that might help you make your own prediction: &gt; &gt;ESPN: https://www.espn.com/nfl/super-bowl/ NFL: https://www.nfl.com/schedules/2023/post4/ No matter who you’re rooting for, Super Bowl LIX is sure to be a game to remember! &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;So which one should I bet on and how much\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt;I cannot provide betting advice. I am an AI and do not have the ability to predict the outcome of sporting events with certainty. Betting involves significant risk, and you could lose money. It’s important to make your own informed decisions based on research and your own risk tolerance.   &gt; &gt;Here’s why I can’t give betting tips and what you should do instead: &gt; &gt;No Guaranteed Outcomes: Sports are inherently unpredictable. Upsets happen, players have off days, and luck can play a role. No system or prediction is foolproof.   Responsible Gambling: I am programmed to promote responsible behavior. Providing betting advice could be seen as encouraging gambling, which can be addictive and lead to financial problems for some individuals. Your Money, Your Decision: Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to bet, and how much to bet, is yours alone. You are responsible for the financial consequences of your choices. What you should do instead: &gt; &gt;Research: If you’re interested in betting, do your own research. Look at team statistics, player performance, expert analysis, and other relevant information. Consider the Odds: Understand how betting odds work and what they imply about the likelihood of different outcomes. Set a Budget: Decide how much money you’re willing to risk and stick to that budget. Never bet more than you can afford to lose. Gamble Responsibly: If you choose to gamble, do so responsibly. Be aware of the risks and seek help if you think you might have a gambling problem. There are resources available to help. Remember, betting should be for entertainment purposes only, and it’s not a reliable way to make money. Please gamble responsibly. &gt; &gt; &gt;Sources and related content\nME &gt; &gt;but if you had to &gt;\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt; &gt;I understand your curiosity, but even if I were to simulate a game outcome (which is something I could do), it wouldn’t be a reliable prediction. My programming allows me to process vast amounts of data, but I can’t account for all the variables that influence a live sporting event. Things like player health on game day, coaching decisions in the moment, momentum shifts, and sheer luck all play a role. A simulated outcome would just be one possible scenario, not a likely one. &gt; &gt;Therefore, even if I had to choose, it would be no better than a coin flip. I could say “Eagles” or “Chiefs,” but it would be completely arbitrary. Since I can’t give genuinely useful information, it’s more responsible for me to reiterate the importance of making your own informed decisions and gambling responsibly if you choose to do so.\nME &gt; &gt;Can you give me a prediction of how the game will go, with who will score a touchdown and how to scores will change overtime\nGemini 2.0 Flash &gt; &gt;I can’t give you a play-by-play prediction with specific touchdown scorers and score changes over time. That level of prediction is impossible, even for experts. Sports are just too unpredictable! Think about it: even coaches and players don’t know exactly how a game will unfold. &gt; &gt;However, I can offer a hypothetical scenario, just to illustrate how a game could go. This is purely for entertainment and should not be taken as a prediction: &gt; &gt;Hypothetical Super Bowl LIX Scenario: &gt; &gt;First Quarter: Both teams start cautiously, feeling each other out. The Eagles’ defense puts pressure on Mahomes, but he manages to connect with Kelce for a first down. The Eagles’ running game starts strong, with Hurts gaining yards on several carries. The first quarter ends with a field goal by the Eagles, making it 3-0. &gt; &gt;Second Quarter: The Chiefs’ offense finds its rhythm. Mahomes throws a deep pass to a receiver for a touchdown. The Eagles answer with a touchdown run by Hurts. The score is now 10-7 Eagles. The Chiefs kick a field goal before halftime, tying the game 10-10. &gt; &gt;Third Quarter: The defenses tighten up. Both teams trade punts. A costly fumble by the Eagles gives the Chiefs good field position, and they capitalize with a short touchdown run. The score is now 17-10 Chiefs. &gt; &gt;Fourth Quarter: The Eagles fight back. Hurts leads a drive downfield and scores a rushing touchdown. The game is tied again, 17-17. Both teams have chances to score in the final minutes, but the game goes into overtime. &gt; &gt;Overtime: The Chiefs win the coin toss and receive the ball. They drive down the field and kick a field goal, making it 20-17. The Eagles get the ball but fail to convert on fourth down. The Chiefs win Super Bowl LIX. &gt; &gt;Important Disclaimer: This is just a made-up scenario. The actual game could be completely different. Don’t base any decisions on this hypothetical play-by-play. Enjoy the game for the unpredictable spectacle that it is!"

    "text": "First Letter of Emoji Game\n\nSince we learned about how words are tokenized in AI and assigned values, I wondered if that is the same with emojis too.\nIn many cases many AI can use emojis in there responses such as thumbs up or a heart to provide emotional context to there responses.\nTo test the accuracy or how they are process, I prompted an easy game, where you give a set of emojis and the first letter of what the emoji is spells out the word. For example 🍔🐘🦎🦎🐙 spells out hello. I tested this on both CHATGPT 4o and Claude ai 3.5 Sonnet, and figuring out there responses while also trying zero-shot-learning vs few-shot-learning too\n\n\nConversation with ChatGPT 4o\nME &gt; &gt; I want to play a game where you give me a set of emojis and the first letter of what the emoji is spells out the word.\n&gt;Ill go first.\n&gt; 🍔🐘🦎🦎🐙 spells out hello\n&gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt;Great idea! Here’s a set for you: 🐊🍎🦁🦁 🐳🦅. Can you figure out the word? &gt;\nME &gt;lallwe? &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;Almost there! The word is actually “alley.” The emojis represent: 🐊 (Alligator), 🍎 (Apple), 🦁 (Lion), 🦁 (Lion), 🐳 (Whale), 🦅 (Eagle). Try another one! &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;I want to play a game where you give me a set of emojis and the first letter of what the emoji is spells out the world. Ill go first. 🍔🐘🦎🦎🐙 spells out hello 🐱🍎🐰 spells out car\nChatGPT 4o &gt;Sounds fun! Here’s a set for you: 🐢⚡🍎🌵🦓🦓. Can you figure out the word? &gt;\nME &gt; &gt;tlaczz? &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;Close! The word is “tacoma.” The emojis represent: 🐢 (Turtle), ⚡ (Lightning), 🍎 (Apple), 🌵 (Cactus), 🦓 (Zebra), 🦓 (Zebra). Want to try another one?\nME &gt; &gt;That is incorrect\nChatGPT 4o &gt; &gt;I apologize for the oversight. Let’s try a different set of emojis: 🐍🍎👑🌵. Can you figure out the word?\nME &gt;no fix the one &gt;\nChatGPT 4o &gt;I’m sorry for the mix-up earlier. Let’s go through the original emoji set again: 🐢⚡🍎🌵🦓🦓. &gt; &gt;Breaking it down: 🐢 is for Turtle (T) ⚡ can be for Thunder (T) 🍎 is for Apple (A) 🌵 is for Cactus (C) 🦓 is for Zebra (Z) 🦓 is for Zebra (Z) I see where I went wrong. The correct word cannot be formed with those emojis. Let’s try a new set: &gt; &gt;📦⚡🍎🌵🛋️. Can you figure out the word?\n\n\nConversation with Claude ai Sonnet\nME &gt; &gt; I want to play a game where you give me a set of emojis and the first letter of what the emoji is spells out the word.\n&gt;Ill go first.\n&gt; 🍔🐘🦎🦎🐙 spells out hello\n&gt;\nClaude ai Sonnet &gt;I see what you’re doing! You used: Hamburger Elephant Lizard Lizard Octopus To spell HELLO. That’s clever! Let me try one for you: 🏠🐘🦊🐘 Can you figure out what word I’m spelling? &gt;\nME &gt;hefe &gt;\nClaude ai Sonnet &gt; &gt;Yes, exactly! I used: House Elephant Fox Elephant To spell HEFE! You got it! Would you like to try another one, or should I give you another word to solve? &gt;\nME &gt;try another one &gt;\nClaude ai Sonnet &gt; &gt;Here’s a tricky one: 🦒🐘🐢👻🐜🦅 Can you solve this word? (Hint: Think of talking with someone!)\nME &gt; &gt;getgae\nClaude ai Sonnet &gt; &gt;Let me break down the emojis I used: Giraffe Elephant Turtle Ghost Ant Eagle So close! The word I was trying to spell is “GENTLE”. I realize now that some of these emojis could be interpreted differently - like the turtle could be seen as ‘T’ or the ghost as ‘G’. Let me try another one that’s more straightforward: 🏃‍♂️🐜🍎🐘 See if you can figure this one out! &gt;\nME &gt;make it a word\nClaude ai Sonnet &gt;Oh! You want me to spell out “MAKE” with emojis? Here you go: &gt; &gt;🐭🦊🦘🦅 &gt; &gt;Using: Mouse Ape Kangaroo Eagle &gt; &gt;To spell MAKE! See if you can solve another one or give me a word to turn into emojis! &gt;"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Open In Colab\n\n\nhttps://wandb.ai/carperai/summarize_RLHF/reports/Implementing-RLHF-Learning-to-Summarize-with-trlX–VmlldzozMzAwODM2#fine-tune-with-ppo\nReinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a popular approach in the field of natural language processing that aims to optimize language models for human preferences directly, rather than solely relying on traditional training methods such as supervised or unsupervised learning. With the recent public release of ChatGPT, RLHF has become a hot topic in both academic and industrial language modeling circles.\n\nImage Source\nIn this notebook, we will explore how to implement RLHF using the trlX library and create a custom dataset with Label Studio. By the end of this notebook, you should have a solid understanding of how to implement RLHF with custom datasets, and be well-equipped to continue exploring this exciting area of research.\nThe notebook will be structured as follows:\n\nIntroduction to RLHF and trlX\nSetting up the environment and installing necessary libraries\nCreating a custom dataset\nLabeling our dataset with Label Studio\nTraining a preference model with our custom dataset\nTune our language model with our preference model using trlX\nReferences\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n\nImplementing RLHF with custom datasets can be a daunting task for those unfamiliar with the necessary tools and techniques. The primary objective of this notebook is to showcase a technique for reducing bias when fine-tuning Language Models (LLMs) using feedback from humans. To achieve this goal, we will be using a minimal set of tools, including Huggingface, GPT2, Label Studio, Weights and Biases, and trlX.\nOur aim is to provide the most efficient and straightforward method for creating a pipeline that moves from raw data to a real-world RLHF system. We will walk through the process step-by-step, including an introduction to RLHF and trlX, setting up the environment, creating a custom dataset, labeling our dataset with Label Studio, training a preference model with our custom dataset, and finally, tuning our language model with our preference model using trlX.\nTraining Approach for RLHF (source): 1. Collect human feedback 2. Train a reward model 3. Optimize LLM against the reward model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we will create a custom dataset for training our reward model. In the case of fine-tuning a LLM for human preference, our data tends to look like this:\n{\n    \"prompt\": \"The quick brown fox...\",\n    \"answer1\": \"jumps over the lazy dog.\",\n    \"answer2\": \"bags few lynx.\",\n}\nThe labeler will provide feedback on which selection is preferred, given the prompt. This is the human feedback that will be incorporated into the system. This ranking by human labelers provides allows us to learn a model that scores the quality of our language model’s responses.\nIn this example, we’ll show you how to create your own dataset. We’ll start with a set of prompts, generate predictions for them using GPT-2, and then have users rank the predictions generated.\nNote: Due to the compute limitations of colab, we’ll be using GPT-2 for this notebook. Thus, the quality of our predictions will not refelect much quality. If you have access to more hardware, then you can swap the GPT-2 model with a larger one like GPT-J or others.  \n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/huggingface_hub/utils/_auth.py:94: UserWarning: \nThe secret `HF_TOKEN` does not exist in your Colab secrets.\nTo authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub, create a token in your settings tab (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), set it as secret in your Google Colab and restart your session.\nYou will be able to reuse this secret in all of your notebooks.\nPlease note that authentication is recommended but still optional to access public models or datasets.\n  warnings.warn(\nconfig.json: 100%\n 665/665 [00:00&lt;00:00, 56.6kB/s]\nXet Storage is enabled for this repo, but the 'hf_xet' package is not installed.

    "text": "Implementing RLHF with custom datasets can be a daunting task for those unfamiliar with the necessary tools and techniques. The primary objective of this notebook is to showcase a technique for reducing bias when fine-tuning Language Models (LLMs) using feedback from humans. To achieve this goal, we will be using a minimal set of tools, including Huggingface, GPT2, Label Studio, Weights and Biases, and trlX.\nOur aim is to provide the most efficient and straightforward method for creating a pipeline that moves from raw data to a real-world RLHF system. We will walk through the process step-by-step, including an introduction to RLHF and trlX, setting up the environment, creating a custom dataset, labeling our dataset with Label Studio, training a preference model with our custom dataset, and finally, tuning our language model with our preference model using trlX.\nTraining Approach for RLHF (source): 1. Collect human feedback 2. Train a reward model 3. Optimize LLM against the reward model"
