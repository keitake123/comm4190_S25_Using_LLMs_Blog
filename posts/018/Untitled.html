<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><img src="abcabc.png" width="700/"></p>
<p>Interviews can bring out a lot of emotions—excitement, pressure, and sometimes even anxiety. As I prepared for an upcoming interview, I found myself battling sleepless nights and overthinking everything. I wasn’t just stressed about how I’d perform; the weight of the situation triggered emotional fatigue. Rather than just rehearsing answers, I needed emotional support. That’s when I decided to try <strong>TherapistGPT</strong>, a version of ChatGPT designed to offer mental wellness guidance.</p>
<p>In this blog, I’ll walk you through my experience using TherapistGPT to work through my interview-related anxiety. It wasn’t just about calming nerves, but about addressing emotional challenges more holistically. From grounding techniques and relaxation exercises to practical advice for tackling interview questions, TherapistGPT became a helpful companion in navigating my stress. It’s a real-time conversation I had with the tool, and I’ll share the full exchange along with insights I gained.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just another chatbot Q&amp;A—it was a transformative experience that gave me the emotional tools to approach my interview with clarity and calm. Read on to see how the conversation unfolded and how I plan to integrate these learnings into my personal well-being.</p>
<hr>

<section id="conversation-log" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conversation-log">Conversation Log</h2>
<p><strong>You said:</strong><br>
I’m feeling anxious about an upcoming interview, what should I do?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong><br>
It’s completely natural to feel anxious before an interview—many people experience that. Your anxiety is a sign that you care about the opportunity and want to do well, which is a strength in itself. Here are a few supportive strategies you can try to help manage that anxiety:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Prepare, But Don’t Overload</strong>
<ul>
<li>Research the company and role.<br>
</li>
<li>Practice common interview questions out loud.<br>
</li>
<li>Prepare a few questions to ask them—it can help shift your focus from being evaluated to being curious.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ground Yourself with Mindfulness</strong>
<ul>
<li>Try a simple breathing exercise: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 6. Repeat a few times to calm your nervous system.<br>
</li>
<li>Do a quick body scan or mindfulness meditation the night before or the day of.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Visualize Success</strong>
<ul>
<li>Imagine yourself walking into the interview confidently, answering questions calmly, and connecting well with the interviewer.<br>
</li>
<li>Visualization can help your brain feel more familiar with the situation, reducing fear of the unknown.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reframe Your Thoughts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Instead of thinking, “What if I mess up?”, try shifting to “This is a chance to share who I am and learn about them too.”<br>
</li>
<li>Remind yourself: It’s not just about being perfect—interviews are conversations, not interrogations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Practice Self-Compassion</strong>
<ul>
<li>Speak kindly to yourself. Acknowledge your anxiety without judgment: “It’s okay to feel nervous. I’m doing something that matters to me.”<br>
</li>
<li>Treat yourself as you would a friend in the same situation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Would you like help practicing specific interview questions or coming up with calming rituals for the day of the interview?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You said:</strong><br>
yes</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong><br>
Great—let’s do both: I’ll give you a calming ritual you can use the day of the interview, and then we can walk through some common interview questions together so you feel more prepared.</p>
<p>🌿 <strong>Calming Ritual for Interview Day</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Morning Grounding (10 minutes)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Right after waking up, sit in stillness.<br>
</li>
<li>Do a breathing exercise: Inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 6 (repeat 5–10 times).<br>
</li>
<li>Say an affirmation: “I am prepared, calm, and capable.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Movement (5–15 minutes)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gentle stretching, yoga, or a short walk to release nervous energy.<br>
</li>
<li>Movement reduces cortisol and boosts confidence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Intentional Prep (20–30 minutes)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Review your resume and 2–3 key stories that showcase your strengths.<br>
</li>
<li>Remind yourself of your “why”—why you want the job and why you’d be great at it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pre-Interview Pause (5 minutes before)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Step away from your notes.<br>
</li>
<li>Breathe deeply. Smile. Sit upright.<br>
</li>
<li>Remind yourself: “This is a conversation. I don’t need to be perfect, just present.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>🎤 <strong>Common Interview Questions Practice</strong><br>
Let’s start with these three: - <strong>Tell me about yourself</strong> – Focus on your path and what led you here.<br>
- <strong>What is your greatest strength?</strong> – Choose something real and back it up with an example.<br>
- <strong>Tell me about a time you faced a challenge at work</strong> – Use the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result.</p>
<p>Would you like to practice one of these now?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You said:</strong><br>
yes</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong><br>
Perfect! Let’s start with <strong>“Tell me about yourself.”</strong></p>
<p>Use this simple structure: - <strong>Present:</strong> What are you doing now? - <strong>Past:</strong> What experiences brought you here? - <strong>Future:</strong> Why are you excited about this role?</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I’m currently working as a customer support specialist, where I’ve been helping users resolve technical issues while improving our support process. Before that, I studied communications and did an internship focused on digital outreach, which got me interested in how businesses build strong customer relationships. Now I’m excited to bring those skills into a role that lets me grow in client-facing responsibilities and contribute to a team that values empathy and innovation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ready to try your version?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You said:</strong><br>
I also can’t sleep because of it. How do I sleep better?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong><br>
That sounds really hard—when anxiety keeps you up at night, it can become a frustrating cycle. You’re not alone in this. Here are some strategies:</p>
<p>🌙 <strong>Sleep Tips Before the Interview</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Wind Down (30–60 minutes before bed)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Avoid bright screens and anything interview-related.<br>
</li>
<li>Try soft music, stretching, or a warm shower.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Write It Out</strong>
<ul>
<li>Brain dump your worries in a notebook.<br>
</li>
<li>Or write reminders: “I’ve done my best. It’s okay to rest.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Guided Breathing</strong>
<ul>
<li>Try the 4-7-8 technique: Inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8.<br>
</li>
<li>Or use apps like Calm or Insight Timer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slowly tense and release muscles from toes to head.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reframe the Pressure</strong>
<ul>
<li>“One rough night won’t ruin the interview. I’ve prepared.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Would you like a relaxation script you can use tonight?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You said:</strong><br>
YES</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong><br>
I’m really glad you said yes. Let’s do this together. Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit or lie down.</p>
<section id="bedtime-relaxation-script-57-minutes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bedtime-relaxation-script-57-minutes">🌙 Bedtime Relaxation Script (5–7 minutes)</h3>
<p>Start with your breath:<br>
Inhale slowly… 1… 2… 3… 4…<br>
Hold…<br>
Exhale… 1… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…<br>
Repeat gently.</p>
<p>Now your feet…<br>
Tense… hold… release.<br>
Then your calves… thighs… hands… shoulders… jaw.<br>
Let go of the tension with each breath.</p>
<p>Now imagine a wave of warm light starting at your feet…<br>
It moves up your body, soothing every muscle…<br>
Softening your thoughts… calming your heart.</p>
<p>Affirm to yourself:<br>
&gt; “I’ve done enough today. I can rest now. I am safe.”</p>
<p>Feel yourself drift. Sleep is welcome here.</p>
<p>Would you like a shorter version to keep?</p>

Also, I feel tired after sleeping too much. What is that?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong><br>
It’s more common than you’d think. Here are a few possible reasons:</p>

</ol>
<p>💡 <strong>What You Can Try</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Set consistent sleep and wake times.<br>
</li>
<li>Get sunlight early in the day.<br>

<section id="takeaway" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<p>Using <strong>TherapistGPT</strong> during a stressful time was unexpectedly helpful. Initially, I thought I’d just get a few tips to calm my nerves, but what I got was much more meaningful. The conversation felt personal and validating—like talking to a supportive friend who knew exactly what I needed to hear.</p>
<p>What I found most valuable was how the tool addressed my anxiety from multiple angles. It didn’t just offer generic advice like “take a deep breath” but walked me through a calming ritual for the day of my interview. The structure for answering the “Tell me about yourself” question was a game-changer, giving me a clear, confident way to share my story.</p>
<p>The bedtime relaxation script was a standout for me. It not only helped me relax the night of the interview but also showed me how much emotional pressure I was holding onto without realizing it. The experience highlighted how anxiety doesn’t always stem from a lack of preparation but from emotional noise we may not always acknowledge.</p>
<p>What surprised me the most was how non-judgmental and empathetic the interaction felt. Instead of a checklist of tips, I felt truly supported through my anxiety. The compassionate tone made a real difference in how I approached the interview process.</p>
<section id="reflections-and-insights" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflections-and-insights">Reflections and Insights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anxiety before a high-stakes situation doesn’t mean I’m unprepared; it means I care.</li>
<li>Reframing my thoughts from “I have to perform” to “I have something to share” can shift my mindset.</li>
<li>Sleep struggles often aren’t just physical; they can be tied to emotional stress that needs attention.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="how-ill-apply-this-going-forward" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-ill-apply-this-going-forward">How I’ll Apply This Going Forward</h3>
<ul>
<li>I’ll turn to <strong>TherapistGPT</strong> for emotional regulation during stressful moments—not just before interviews, but before presentations or tough conversations.</li>
<li>I’ll use the morning ritual and breathing techniques more regularly to manage stress, not just in high-pressure moments but in everyday life.</li>
<li>I’ll be more proactive in recognizing when I’m emotionally overwhelmed and ask for help, whether from AI or a human.</li>
<li>I’ll continue exploring therapy options in my city. Emotional wellness isn’t just about coping with breakdowns—it’s about ongoing growth and care.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, this experience showed me that <strong>TherapistGPT</strong> isn’t just a tool for stress management; it’s a way to approach emotional wellness with intention. Technology, when designed thoughtfully, can truly be a part of our personal growth and healing process.</p>
