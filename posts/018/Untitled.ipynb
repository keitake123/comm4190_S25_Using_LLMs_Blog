    "\n",

    "## Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **TherapistGPT** during a stressful time was unexpectedly helpful. Initially, I thought I‚Äôd just get a few tips to calm my nerves, but what I got was much more meaningful. The conversation felt personal and validating‚Äîlike talking to a supportive friend who knew exactly what I needed to hear.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I found most valuable was how the tool addressed my anxiety from multiple angles. It didn‚Äôt just offer generic advice like ‚Äútake a deep breath‚Äù but walked me through a calming ritual for the day of my interview. The structure for answering the ‚ÄúTell me about yourself‚Äù question was a game-changer, giving me a clear, confident way to share my story.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bedtime relaxation script was a standout for me. It not only helped me relax the night of the interview but also showed me how much emotional pressure I was holding onto without realizing it. The experience highlighted how anxiety doesn‚Äôt always stem from a lack of preparation but from emotional noise we may not always acknowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "What surprised me the most was how non-judgmental and empathetic the interaction felt. Instead of a checklist of tips, I felt truly supported through my anxiety. The compassionate tone made a real difference in how I approached the interview process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflections and Insights\n",
    "- Anxiety before a high-stakes situation doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm unprepared; it means I care.\n",
    "- Reframing my thoughts from ‚ÄúI have to perform‚Äù to ‚ÄúI have something to share‚Äù can shift my mindset.\n",
    "- Sleep struggles often aren‚Äôt just physical; they can be tied to emotional stress that needs attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How I‚Äôll Apply This Going Forward\n",
    "- I‚Äôll turn to **TherapistGPT** for emotional regulation during stressful moments‚Äînot just before interviews, but before presentations or tough conversations.\n",
    "- I‚Äôll use the morning ritual and breathing techniques more regularly to manage stress, not just in high-pressure moments but in everyday life.\n",
    "- I‚Äôll be more proactive in recognizing when I‚Äôm emotionally overwhelmed and ask for help, whether from AI or a human.\n",
    "- I‚Äôll continue exploring therapy options in my city. Emotional wellness isn‚Äôt just about coping with breakdowns‚Äîit‚Äôs about ongoing growth and care.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this experience showed me that **TherapistGPT** isn‚Äôt just a tool for stress management; it‚Äôs a way to approach emotional wellness with intention. Technology, when designed thoughtfully, can truly be a part of our personal growth and healing process."
