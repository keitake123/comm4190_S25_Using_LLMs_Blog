    "Implementing RLHF with custom datasets can be a daunting task for those unfamiliar with the necessary tools and techniques. The primary objective of this notebook is to showcase a technique for reducing bias when fine-tuning Language Models (LLMs) using feedback from humans. To achieve this goal, we will be using a minimal set of tools, including Huggingface, GPT2, Label Studio, Weights and Biases, and trlX.\n",

We will walk through the process step-by-step, including an introduction to RLHF and trlX, setting up the environment, creating a custom dataset, labeling our dataset with Label Studio, training a preference model with our custom dataset, and finally, tuning our language model with our preference model using trlX.\n",
