    "\n",
    "The hot topic in tech right now is most certainly AI and everything that’s involved in it. Machine learning is perhaps the most important aspect for AI but, as JavaScript developers, is it something we can do in our beloved programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "The title of this article sort of kills the suspense and so yes! It’s possible! Even better news is that this article is going to provide a gentle introduction to machine learning in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll walk through the process of creating a model that can make predictions based on data we provide, and I’ll explain each step so that you don’t get lost along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a gentle introduction, so the aim is to help you understand how you can implement machine learning in JavaScript without going too deep into the machine learning abyss.\n",

    "## Setting Up Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re going to start from absolute scratch, so what you’ll need to do is create a folder and give it a name. Mine is called `machine-learning-beginners`. Open this folder in your code editor of choice — I will be using **VS Code** — open the terminal and make sure you are in the correct folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to run `npm init` to create a Node.js project. Once you run this command in your terminal you will be prompted to add some information about the project. I’m going to be super lazy and I’m just going to leave it empty for now (you can either add the info now or later but it’s not too important for the demo):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm init\n",
    "We then need to install TensorFlow.js:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "npm install @tensorflow/tfjs\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, create an index.js file and import TensorFlow.js:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// index.js\n",
    "// Use CommonJS require syntax to import TensorFlow.js\n",
    "const tf = require(\"@tensorflow/tfjs\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Setup done! Now, we can start writing some machine learning code!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Prediction Model in JavaScript\n",
    "First it’s probably good to outline what our model should do:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve read my previous articles, you might know that I’m a huge football (the round one) fan, and so we are going to create a model that predicts the result of a football match based on the previous results between two teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Data\n",
    "Now we can get started on the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of machine learning is data, and so we need to provide our model with data to train it. The data we are going to provide is the last 20 results between Liverpool FC and Everton FC. The focus will be on Liverpool and so they will always be the first input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// index.js\n",
    "const tf = require(\"@tensorflow/tfjs\");\n",
    "\n",
    "// Step 1: Add the training data\n",
    "// Liverpool FC = 0\n",
    "// Everton = 1\n",
    "const trainingData = [\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [1, 0, 0] }, // Liverpool win\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [0, 0, 1] }, // Draw\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [1, 0, 0] }, // Liverpool win\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [1, 0, 0] }, // Liverpool win\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [0, 1, 0] }, // Liverpool lose\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [0, 0, 1] }, // Draw\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [0, 0, 1] }, // Draw\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [1, 0, 0] }, // Liverpool win\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [1, 0, 0] }, // Liverpool win\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [0, 0, 1] }, // Draw\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [1, 0, 0] }, // Liverpool win\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [0, 0, 1] }, // Draw\n",

    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [1, 0, 0] }, // Liverpool win\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [0, 0, 1] }, // Draw\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [0, 0, 1] }, // Draw\n",
    "  { input: [0, 1], output: [0, 0, 1] }, // Draw\n",
    "];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What Does This Mean?\n",
    "Well, first of all we have created an array of objects, and each object shows one game result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs\n",
    "We have two inputs: 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "0 represents Liverpool and\n",
    "\n",
    "1 represents Everton.\n",
    "\n",
    "We always have Liverpool as the first input because our focus is on Liverpool’s results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to represent our categorical data (the football team names) using numerical values because machine learning algorithms primarily work with numerical data. But don’t let that confuse you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs\n",
    "We have three outputs which represent: win, lose, draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Liverpool wins, the output will be [1, 0, 0].\n",
    "\n",
    "If they lose, it will be [0, 1, 0].\n",
    "\n",
    "If they draw, it will be [0, 0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice! It’s not a lot of training data but it’s good enough for our first prediction model. So, let’s dive in:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing the Model\n",
    "Next, we create a model and add layers that will help the model learn from the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// index.js\n",
    "// Step 2: Construct the model\n",
    "const model = tf.sequential();\n",
    "model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 10, inputShape: [2], activation: \"relu\" }));\n",
    "model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 3, activation: \"softmax\" }));\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here’s what’s happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential model: A simple model where layers are stacked on top of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "First Layer: A dense layer with 10 units and ReLU activation (non-linearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second Layer: A dense output layer with 3 units, one for each possible outcome (win, lose, draw) using softmax to give probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compiling the Model\n",
    "Now we need to compile the model, which optimizes it for training:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// index.js \n",
    "// Step 3: Compile the model\n",
    "model.compile({ loss: \"categoricalCrossentropy\", optimizer: \"adam\" });\n",
    "```\n",
    "Categorical Cross-Entropy: Used for multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam Optimizer: A popular algorithm to optimize the model by adjusting weights during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing Training Data\n",
    "Now that we have our model, we need to format our data into tensors, which the machine learning algorithm can work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// index.js \n",
    "// Step 4: Prepare the training data\n",
    "const xTrain = tf.tensor2d(trainingData.map((item) => item.input));\n",
    "const yTrain = tf.tensor2d(trainingData.map((item) => item.output));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training the Model\n",
    "We now train the model using our training data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// index.js \n",
    "// Step 5: Train the model\n",
    "async function trainModel() {\n",
    "  await model.fit(xTrain, yTrain, { epochs: 100 });\n",
    "  console.log(\"Training complete!\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note on Epochs:\n",
    "Increasing the number of epochs can potentially improve the model’s performance, but may also risk overfitting the data. Experimentation is key to finding the right number of epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 'Making Predictions\n",
    "Once our model is trained, we can use it to make predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// index.js \n",
    "// Step 6: Make predictions\n",
    "function makePredictions() {\n",
    "  const testData = [\n",
    "    { input: [0, 1] } // Liverpool vs. Everton\n",
    "  ];\n",
    "  const predictions = model.predict(\n",
    "    tf.tensor2d(testData.map((item) => item.input))\n",
    "  );\n",
    "  const predictedResults = Array.from(predictions.dataSync());\n",
    "  \n",
    "  testData.forEach((data, index) => {\n",
    "    const predictedOutcome = predictedResults.slice(index * 3, (index + 1) * 3);\n",
    "    console.log(`Match ${index + 1}: Liverpool ${data.input[0]} vs. Everton ${data.input[1]}`);\n",
    "    console.log(\"Predicted outcome:\", predictedOutcome);\n",
    "  });\n",

    "## Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Building this prediction model in JavaScript was both empowering and exciting. At the start, I thought machine learning would be too complex for me to handle within the JavaScript ecosystem, but I was pleasantly surprised by how easy TensorFlow.js made it. Instead of needing to understand every detail about neural networks or optimization techniques, I was able to focus on the logic and structure of the model, making it a lot more approachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "What stood out to me was how accessible machine learning can be when it’s integrated into the language and tools you already use every day. JavaScript isn’t just for building websites anymore—it's a solid tool for experimenting with AI and data science. TensorFlow.js made the whole process feel seamless, allowing me to build, train, and make predictions with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project also gave me a deeper understanding of the importance of data. Even though the dataset I used was relatively small (just match results between Liverpool and Everton), I was still able to extract useful insights. This reinforced a key point for me: you don’t need massive datasets to get started. Even small, well-structured data can lead to valuable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, I’m excited about the possibilities with machine learning in JavaScript. From building real-time prediction apps to exploring deep learning and neural networks, the path forward is full of potential. This experience has opened up a new world of opportunities, and I can’t wait to explore further.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, I’m planning to dive deeper into more complex datasets and refine my models. Whether it’s for predicting sports outcomes, stock market trends, or even personalized recommendations, the potential of machine learning in JavaScript feels endless.\n"
