    "# First Letter of Emoji Game \n",
    "\n",
    "* Since we learned about how words are tokenized in AI and assigned values, I wondered if that is the same with emojis too.\n",
    "* In many cases many AI can use emojis in there responses such as thumbs up or a heart to provide emotional context to there responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To test the accuracy or how they are process, I prompted an easy game, where you give a set of emojis and the first letter of what the emoji is spells out the word. For example 🍔🐘🦎🦎🐙 spells out hello. I tested this on both CHATGPT 4o and Claude ai 3.5 Sonnet, and figuring out there responses while also trying zero-shot-learning vs few-shot-learning too"
